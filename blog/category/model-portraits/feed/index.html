										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/moostapha-saidi/">MOOSTAPHA SAIDI</a>, 27.</strong></p>
<p>We all remember Winnie Harlow, the first famous vitiligo model. From that Desigual campaign until now, the industry has luckily become more <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/5-models-changing-the-modeling-industry/">inclusive and diverse</a>, and models with vitiligo have now more visibility than ever before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/moostapha_s/">Moostapha Saidi</a> is a 27-year-old vitiligo model based in South Africa. His appearance is very unique and of course, has awakened interest from brands all over the world, such as Fila or The Messi Store. In this interview, Moostapha explains how he started working as a model, his purpose and he also gives some tips on how to become a vitiligo model.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How did you start suffering from vitiligo? Is it something you were born with?</strong></h2>
<p>I personally don’t know anyone who was born with it. I developed it with time. It just started with two tiny dots on my lips. I didn’t really pay attention to it. But as time went by, they started to spread out. When this happened, I was uncomfortable of course, because I was strange. Everybody was curious, it wasn’t something “normal”.</p>
<p>I was young, but as time went on, I learned to deal with it. People ask, look at you… This could have bothered me as a kid, but gradually I learned how to deal with this type of comments. Eventually, I found a way to infuse this into my modeling career.</p>
<h2><strong>How old were you?</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t remember exactly. I was at school and I remember children constantly asking me what those white dots were.</p>
<h2><strong>All models have to take care of their skin. As a vitiligo model, do you take extra care?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, I need to take care of my skin, for example, not being exposed to the sun a lot. I do regular skin care, with natural products. I have to look after myself.</p>
<h2><strong>Is your skin constantly changing?</strong></h2>
<p>It does change. I like to say I’m a chameleon. I cannot assure if I will be fully white or fully black. It moves around. I’m happy with every shape as long as I’m just me.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84299" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84299" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84299 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NTk5IiwiZiI6InBuZyJ9.png" alt="Moostapha model with vitiligo in the pool" width="640" height="800" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84299" class="wp-caption-text">Moostapha Saidi captured by Caroline Lima</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>We know that models have to update their polaroids constantly. Do you have to update your polaroids because your skin changes?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes. In my modeling agency, we have sessions where we constantly update the polaroids. I try to maintain my skin not exposing it to hard things, like the sun. I’m also constantly applying sunscreen. I protect myself, but I don’t mind if it changes and my modeling agency either.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84396 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>You explained that vitiligo started when you were very young. Did you feel different or have insecurities back then?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, I did. I always had the same doubts. Am I going to like to someone? How are they going to treat me? Am I ever going to have a girlfriend? I used to wonder this type of things. But as time moved on, I realized it wasn’t as bad as I imagined in my head.</p>
<h2><strong>Have you ever felt that you don’t find your place because you’re black and white?</strong></h2>
<p>I always tell my friends I’m both races. First of all, I’m African. Number 2, I’m Moostapha. And number 3, I’m black and white.</p>
<h2><strong>How did you start your modeling career? Was it because of vitiligo or had you already thought about it?</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve always been a person who has maintained himself and has an interest in the industry. I started collaborating with  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justin_dingwall/">Justin Dingwall</a>, an artist based in South Africa. We created a series of images. These images were about my personal story: wherever I go, everybody looks at me, that’s the meaning behind it. This type of art projects introduced me to the modeling industry and it all started with that. I signed with an agency based in South Africa. From there, I kept working until today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84291" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84291 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/OTc0IiwiZiI6InBuZyJ9.png" alt="Moostapha Saidi by Justin Dingwall eyes" width="640" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84291" class="wp-caption-text">Moostapha Saidi captured by Justin Dingwall</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>So, in these pictures, you didn’t have any experience? They look very professional!</strong></h2>
<p>You know, it’s so crazy. When we did this shooting, it was actually a freestyle. We had no preparation, not even the message. The message was decided once the shooting was done. There was no preconceived idea.</p>
<h2><strong>And do you work as a model full-time?</strong></h2>
<p>No, I’m a student. I’m studying at the University of South Africa Economics and Management Sciences, I’m a model and try to take every opportunity that takes my way. I cannot say I’m a model part time because I take every single opportunity, but definitely I’m not full time. I’m trying to learn constantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84417 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>What do you think about modeling? Is it a way to give visibility to vitiligo?</strong></h2>
<p>For me modeling is about sustainability, about how I sustain this. Modeling is about to give a voice to those ones who can’t speak for themselves, standing for those who have lack of confidence. I bring diversity to modeling with the way I look. For me, modeling is a way of communicating style, tolerance, character. It’s a way of touching society in different ways, it’s a way to educate us for the future. Definitely, for me it’s educational. If you ask me the type of model I am, I wouldn’t know what to say. What I enjoy is collaborating with other artists and create meaningful relationships.</p>
<h2><strong>How long have you been modeling?</strong></h2>
<p>This is my third year.</p>
<h2><strong>Wow, you’ve been modeling only for 3 years?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes! I never had a chance before that collaboration with the photographer.</p>
<h2><strong>Was vitiligo a problem to access the industry or did it help you to stand out?</strong></h2>
<p>I feel different in the industry because all the models I see are tall and slim. But it’s all about what makes you different, about how a company can transmit its values through you. Vitiligo does play a part when brands do really need somebody different and colorful. So yes, it does help me a little in terms of diversity.  Every chance I get I take to my advantage that I’m diverse.</p>
<h2><strong>We all remember Winnie Harlow, the first famous vitiligo model. Do you think the modeling industry is becoming more diverse?</strong></h2>
<p>I think the industry is inclusive, but companies also have interests. If brands can put the same trust in tall people than in a person with vitiligo, that is something great and means that the industry is changing. There’s a lot of decision players.</p>
<h2><strong>We know you’ve worked with huge brands such as Fila or the Messi Store. What was it like to work with these brands?</strong></h2>
<p>With the Messi’s Store, it was incredible. The contract with my agency ended and I was wondering how I could stay busy and I got in touch with them. One morning I just woke up and they told me they liked my idea. I started jumping up and down. I called my photographer and explained the project and we did it. It was an important moment for me. I had never had this connection with brands since I was represented by an agency. So now, standing by myself and having to work with this big client, I learned a lot.</p>
<p>The Fila experience was great, I went to a casting and I got selected. It was a good experience, but not as meaningful as with the Messi’s Store since I did all that by myself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84293 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/OTI4IiwiZiI6ImpwZyJ9.jpeg" alt="Moostapha Saidi x Fila" width="900" height="1350" /></p>
<h2><strong>Did these experiences help you to get more visibility?</strong></h2>
<p>They are very meaningful for me. It teaches me how to position myself for the next opportunity. And yes, it helps me to get more visibility from brands, or not just brands, but to key individuals of the industry. If you are someone who has the ability to communicate with clients is great to manage your own career.</p>
<h2><strong>What would be your next professional achievement?</strong></h2>
<p>My next professional goal would be to create my own brand. I want to transfer my skin to products, such as socks, gloves, shoes. I would love it that people who wear them can feel like me. That’s my next professional goal. I’m trying so hard to put myself in one piece of material so you can feel like me.</p>
<h2><strong>Do you think that your look makes you special, or is it more about the attitude?</strong></h2>
<p>I would like to say that it’s the attitude. Anyone could do what I’m doing, honestly. It’s just about the attitude and the willing to constantly do better. I wouldn’t say my look makes me better, but yes, I’m different and I accept it. I’m not uncomfortable with it, I’m blessed and I’m unique. I’m blessed to be looking like this and to be able to add value to society. But I also work to be consistent and stay busy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84297" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84297 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/OTY4IiwiZiI6InBuZyJ9.png" alt="model with vitiligo moostapha saidi" width="640" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84297" class="wp-caption-text">Moostapha Saidi captured by Justin Dingwall</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>What message would you like to send to those who want to start their modeling careers but feel insecure about themselves?</strong></h2>
<p>I would say don’t sit on it. The time is now and the hardest thing is discipline. Honestly, it’s just to assume that there is no better time than now. So, I would rather say, feel free, live your life, learn as much as you want, and be curious. And always have in mind that there are people who are better and others who are worse, so you’re in the middle and this way you’re prepared for any situation.</p>
<h2><strong>How do you think ModelManagement.com can help someone’s career?</strong></h2>
<p>I think ModelManagement.com has a great advantage for models who are starting because they offer so much information about how the industry works. I remember when I started the <a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/">Model Academy</a>, it enlightened me and helped me to know how castings work, how agencies work, how models should behave… There are people who don’t have the knowledge, and ModelManagement.com provides the right information so all models know the industry.</p>
<p>I think it’s also interesting the way the Model Academy educates in terms of the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/">types of models</a> there are, beyond the basic runway models. People can actually do different things, and I don’t think people out there understand this. ModelManagement.com educates people in the modeling industry.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for this opportunity. Thank you for this chance to share my story as a vitiligo model, I’m happy to be part of this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model: Irina Pavlova.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>IRINA PAVLOVA, 30 years ols. Ryazan, Russia.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Irina Pavlova would never have imagined that her intention to learn English would change the course of her life and make her a professional model once she finished college.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The protagonist of this new post is a very intelligent and professional model, who knows the fashion industry very well. Tireless, demanding, and always ready to help others, it is a pleasure to learn about her experiences as a model and learn from the advice that has led her to work for the most important international brands and magazines in the world of fashion.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">How does your modeling journey begin?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was born in a village two hours away from Moscow. I never traveled abroad until I was in my twenties. In fact, the first time I saw the sea I was 19 years old, I had only seen lakes and rivers before. My world was very small, I knew there was much to see but I could not taste it. When I made my first trip to the south of Russia, I discovered that I loved traveling and wanted more and more. I knew there was something wrong, Ryazan, my hometown, is beautiful, but I always felt that I had to go somewhere else. I studied at the University, moved to Moscow, and worked for an international company. I was happy, but I needed more, and above all, <a href="https://branch.learnmatch.com/?_branch_match_id=905055540638899838">I wanted to improve my English</a> as well. The funny thing is that, during this time working, I had job offers as a model, sometimes they would stop me on the street inviting me to the agencies&#8230; But I was not really interested. Until a day came when I thought that maybe modeling would allow me to travel and work abroad and learn English. My initial plan was to go back to the office with much better English… (laughs)</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84073" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ira.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="1165" /></p>
<h2><span class="s1">You left for a limited time, without expecting all the good that was yet to come &#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I signed a contract with an agency in Moscow and then I had the opportunity to move to Milan to work. That was, in fact, my first big trip. I was fascinated, I really did not expect that in this world I would meet such interesting people as <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers">photographers</a>, designers, stylists&#8230; Sometimes it seems incredible that you get paid for this job because it is truly wonderful, but it is a profession. I lived in Milan for a while, traveling and working a lot in Europe, until one day I got a contract to work in New York, where I have lived for four years.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;You do not have to think about how many times you are rejected but about moving forward with your goal&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="s1">How was the experience of moving to the capital of fashion?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it was tough, I had to be much stronger to survive. You have to have a strong character to be a model, especially in a city like New York. You have to be able to cope well with the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/rejection-and-mental-health-in-modeling/">rejections</a> you may have, knowing that you can go to a casting or to an agency and that many times they tell you no. To cope with this, you do not have to think about how many times you are rejected but about moving forward with your goal. You have to keep moving forward because even though they have told you no twenty times, perhaps the next time will be a big “yes” and that job changes your life forever. I think the world of fashion is a bit of a mystery to people. People really don&#8217;t know how it works. Everyone believes that there is only magic in it, that everyone is handsome, it seems easy but it is a lot of hard work.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>“It is important for young people to know that having a good personality and character is a strong trigger when it comes to getting a job”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="s1">Besides the physical, can the attitude of a model make a difference?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Very much. In fact, I know many people who have lost opportunities because their attitude in the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/">casting</a> has not been good. It is important for young people to know that having a good personality and character is a strong trigger when it comes to getting a job, and now more than ever. Attitude is the way you deal with people, how you communicate, what you post on the networks, how you take care of the image you project…</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84396" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2><span class="s1">What advice can you give to aspiring models?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Without a doubt, my advice is that, in addition to having a good portfolio, you should be prepared to make mistakes. You have to be alert and very professional from the beginning. You should not take this job as entertainment or fun, it is much more than looking good, having your makeup done or being dressed in nice clothes&#8230; Sometimes the client may not be happy with you because surely you have not paid enough attention or interest. You have to know how to listen to the client, try to understand them to give them what they want. Personally, I like to ask if I am posing well, if they like how the project is turning out &#8230; It&#8217;s a very competitive world and if you want to be hired for other times, I think you have to pay attention to the little details from the beginning. It may be that I have this thought because I previously worked in a company and perhaps I have that corporate vision, but I always try to be very professional, to be punctual and I believe that all of this helps any career. I also try to always carry my casting essentials with me in case one day I have to literally rush out to a last-minute casting.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84075 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IRA-PAVLOVA-1.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="518" /></p>
<h2><span class="s1">What has impressed you the most about fashion and what do you think can be improved?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It amazes me and I really like the power of a model, discovering that a model can really influence the process of a project. That we are much more than just a beautiful person and that we have the power to make sales grow and take them to another level. Also, the number of people who work in fashion with such diverse professions and talents is also wonderful. I love the diversity of this world, especially in New York where there are so many cultures, so many different professionals and ideals collaborating together. New York is a melting place. The things that could be improved are, for me, those related to the environment. At a particular level, I try to work with brands that are aware of the issue and my goal in the future is to be able to choose and decide to work for those firms that are most concerned about the environment and the planet. I hope all designers end up joining in this thought. I worked, for example, for Stella McCartney and I loved her philosophy. They use Vegetarian Leather, which is not real leather, but it looks great. I think that the world of fashion should go in this direction, it is not only about art. And there is still a long way to go.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Do you take care of yourself much more now than before?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I used to do sports before being a model. I am very active in general, but it is true that when you enter the world of fashion you have to take care of yourself much more. You care more about your appearance, about your skin, simply because it is a very big competition and you are always surrounded by beautiful people. When you go to a casting, you see everyone so beautiful and sometimes you may think, &#8220;Should I still go home?&#8221; (laughs)… That is very positive for me because I am very competitive and that keeps me active. I do yoga, running&#8230; I do many activities that make me fit but also healthy. I have never gone crazy or radical with the diet, I try to be careful, drink a lot of water and sometimes I have to say no to a dessert, but I do everything in a healthy way. The secret is to find the balance.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">And on a mental level?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is no rule that explains how to survive in the world of modeling. The reality is that, like everyone else, we have ups and downs. When I have a bad day and I don&#8217;t feel emotionally stable, doing physical exercise is my first resource to relax, the second is to take a salt bath, and lastly, my friends. It is very important to have friends that you can trust, who can listen to you, and with whom you can share the things that have happened to you throughout the day. I think doing something that inspires you also helps, because apart from the castings and working, you have to do something that gives you pleasure, meditate, spend time with yourself, painting, drawing&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84079" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IRA-PAVLOVA-2.jpg" alt="" width="845" height="734" /></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Talking about friends. Is it easy to make friends in New York?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The good thing about New York is that it is easy to find people with whom you can spend time and who understand you because the people who are living here are people from all over the world. Everyone empathizes with you. On the other hand, in Milan, I only interacted with Italians because there is not as much diversity as in New York. Here you interact with people from all over the world from the first moment and I found great friends that I love. They are my strength, I would even say that we are a team, we help and support each other a lot. Without them, it would be very difficult.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Modeling has always been considered a profession where you retire young, do you think about it?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course! I think everyone will agree that the world of modeling has a very short professional life&#8230; But I like changes in the world! And the changes that are happening are also related to age, there are new trends because customers now want to see real people. In America especially, there is a lot of market for people of 35, 40, 50&#8230; Models who look great, who are doing great modeling jobs. I think you can always do better jobs the more experience you have, so if you take care of yourself, I think that nowadays you can work many years in this industry.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">What is your professional future plan?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My plan is to stay in the industry for a long time. We are at a time where everything is changing, great projects are emerging, and personally, I have very interesting jobs coming and I am enjoying my job a lot. One of them is my participation as a model in the Reboot of the series &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221;, with which I am also entering the world of acting. The world of fashion can lead you to enter others and that is wonderful and a great opportunity.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">As you say, we are in a moment of change, especially in terms of digitization&#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yes, especially in the wake of the Covid. Like all crises, it leaves something positive… In this case, we have seen that the fashion industry has adapted quickly and well to the new reality. Now we have <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/modelmanagement-com-for-online-projects-in-the-modeling-industry/">online castings and also online jobs</a>, fittings, photoshoots&#8230; I see it in a positive way that we adapt to these circumstances. I think that sooner or later, we will return a little to the old normality, it will alternate, but the reality is that now there is another new way of working in fashion. I used to travel a lot before the pandemic, and I miss traveling to Europe, but now I have extra time that I didn&#8217;t have before and I can take advantage of it to do other things, like connect with other professionals through the Internet.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;I have received very good feedback from the client when they have given me freedom to create&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84081" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IRA-PAVLOVA-3.jpg" alt="" width="841" height="762" /></h2>
<h2><span class="s1">What are your main jobs?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I think I am unique. I feel that I can do everything, I can do catwalks, I can do editorials, presentations, showrooms, I have also done many fittings&#8230; I feel that I have dealt with all aspects of the fashion industry and I think that for me the most exciting thing is to do editorials because seeing you in a magazine is wonderful and also its creation process, where I can make strange poses, improvise, have more freedom&#8230; It is a more artistic work. I appreciate it a lot when the client gives me the freedom to do my bit on a creative level. I have received very good feedback from the client when they have given me a chance to create, they appreciate it a lot and usually, they will hire you again because they have loved it.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">What would you like to convey to people when they see your photos?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I would like to inspire them, motivate them, be helpful, I would like to have a good influence on them. Be a source of inspiration.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Has fashion changed you?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yes, definitely. It is difficult to say to what level it has changed me, but yes. I have met hundreds of super creative people, I have worked with different people and ideas all the time, every day I try to work on myself and I keep changing a lot. I think I have become more sensitive to beauty because in this job you live, work and connect with many artistic people, who know a lot about it. I try to feel the beauty.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>“I would have loved that when I started, I would have had a support like “Model Academy”. It would have been a great help&#8221;</b></span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">How did your adventure at ModelManagement.com begin?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I registered on the platform in the wake of the pandemic. Obviously, I had more time and I checked the web and saw a lot of casting offers. I liked it, I created a profile and started applying to castings. I found it very interesting and very helpful, especially the concept of the <a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/">Model Academy</a> because they have many professionals who know the world of fashion and who give appropriate advice to all applicants. I would have loved that when I started, I had had such big support like this. It would have been a great help. Also, thanks to Modelmanagement.com you enter a huge community of artists. Later, from the platform itself, they contacted me to be an Ambassador and I was delighted to accept because I like to think that I can help new generations to find their way.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">What would you highlight most about ModelManagement.com?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The great opportunities it offers to professionals and security. I love the wonderful diversity of the ease of connecting with professionals and how they give information and help about the world of modeling. Also, the fact that it is an honest platform, with secure contracts&#8230; I think Modelmanagement.com is on the right path. The future holds many changes, and model platforms are not exempt from it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinesoranzo/?hl=es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justine Soranzo</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>JUSTINE SORANZO</b></span><span class="s2">, 24 years old. Paris. Model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Personal branding in Modeling is as essential as Social Media today. Justine is a French model based in Paris. With her own style, she has shown the world her sophisticated and elegant personal branding, she is a very active model on social networks and has over a hundred thousand followers on Instagram. Justine delights her audience by showing her lifestyle and work without filters, and she believes that the way she communicates, so close and real, is the key to her success.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Who is Justine? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model</a>, I am 24 years old and I have been living in Paris for almost 5 years. </span><span class="s1">I love to read, I read a lot and above all I love strolling through bookshops. I also did a lot of dancing, for 13 years (jazz, classical, and tap).</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83808" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83808 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justine-black.jpg" alt="Model-Justine-Soranzo" width="1080" height="1334" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83808" class="wp-caption-text">Model Justine Soranzo</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How did you start your modeling career? Has it always been your dream since you were a child? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I started taking pictures at the age of 15 as an <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/new-face/">amateur model</a>, for fun. I would shoot with different <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photographers</a> around my parents&#8217; house (near Grenoble), and I would publish these photos on my Facebook page. Then at the age of 19, a scout noticed me thanks to the photos I published every week on my social networks. He wrote to me saying that he had sent my photos to a big <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modeling agency</a> in Paris and that they were interested in my profile and wanted to see me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I went to Paris and met them. They took my measurements, took polas and looked at my professional photos. They told me that everything was ok, that they were very interested in my profile and wanted me in their agency on the condition that I came to live in Paris. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn&#8217;t necessarily a childhood dream to become a model. I loved to pose in front of the lenses of some photographers but I never thought I would be scouted. </span></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How did you become a professional model? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stopped my studies along the way to start modeling 100%, but I don&#8217;t regret it at all. I had started studying in the commercial field, but I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do yet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My family has always supported me and never told me that I absolutely had to continue my studies, on the contrary, they told me that I had to try my luck in Paris! </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>“It is thanks to publishing again and again on the networks that you will be spotted one day”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>What advice can you give to an aspiring model? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simply to believe in yourself and to <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/castings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoot</a> with different photographers. You have to shoot as much as possible to become more and more comfortable in front of the camera. Then share your photos on the networks in order to create contacts in the field (new photographers will then start to contact you to collaborate with them) and it is thanks to publishing again and again on the networks that you will be spotted one day. If not, don&#8217;t give up. Keep shooting, and once you have a good &#8220;book&#8221; with different photographers (3-4 different shoots minimum) you can start sending your application to modeling agencies around the world. Don&#8217;t forget also to <a href="https://youtu.be/je4V0kw14w8">make nice polas</a>, these are essential photos that will capture your natural beauty for the agency.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83810" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83810" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83810 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justine-vintage.jpg" alt="Personal-Branding-Justine-Soranzo" width="1080" height="1313" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83810" class="wp-caption-text">Model Justine Soranzo</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>“Don&#8217;t be afraid of the lens and don&#8217;t be afraid of giving yourself a role. Knowing how to pose can of course be learned over time, and with experience”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How do you feel in front of a camera? Knowing how to pose and how to be a model is learned over time and experience&#8230; Do you improve and become more self-confident over time? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In front of a camera, I feel very comfortable, in front of people too. This is the number one rule. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the lens and don&#8217;t be afraid of giving yourself a role. Knowing how to pose can of course be learned over time, and with experience. The more you shoot, the simpler it becomes for you. After almost 5 years as a model, nothing frightens me anymore. Shooting outside often means that many people will stop to look at you, but don&#8217;t let yourself be distracted, don&#8217;t be shy, you have to ignore it. For my part, it doesn&#8217;t bother me at all, because I stay focused on my job. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>“The more you work, the more you earn and that&#8217;s something extremely motivating in this field”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>What is the best and worst thing about your profession? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best thing as a model is to be free, if tomorrow I don&#8217;t want to work, I tell my agencies and I don&#8217;t work. If I am offered a job that I don&#8217;t want to do I tell them and I don&#8217;t do it. We make our own choices. Well, at least for me. But of course, the aim is not to refuse jobs, it&#8217;s just to explain a little bit the choice we have, the fact that we are quite free and don&#8217;t have fixed working hours or days. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes I can work 20 days in a month, sometimes only 4 or 5 days. So yes the gap is big but you get used to it over time and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s nice about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps the worst thing in this environment would be not knowing how much we&#8217;re going to earn each month? But for me it&#8217;s not negative. With time we know which months work best in modeling and we know that some months will be lower than others. I like the fact that I can earn different amounts each month. The more you work, the more you earn and that&#8217;s something extremely motivating in this field.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84417 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>You have a beautiful and sophisticated style. What inspires you or what inspires you to create your style? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Parisian style of course! Paris has brought me a certain fashion style, that&#8217;s for sure. As a model, I have become much more assertive in my style. I like simple things, but when added together they give a sophisticated look. Colors that are generally quite neutral, giving this ever-chic side. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I get a lot of inspiration on social media, both from modern pieces as well as from more vintage pieces and through the style of some people who are sometimes opposed to each other such as Jeanne Damas, Kendall Jenner or Brigitte Bardot.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83812" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83812" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83812 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justine-paris.jpg" alt="Justine-Model-Paris" width="1080" height="1320" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83812" class="wp-caption-text">Model Justin Soranzo in Paris</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How do you make yourself visible on social media? What is your trick or your way to get more visibility? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Publishing often on your networks is extremely important. It&#8217;s like when I often published my photos on Facebook back then. Today it&#8217;s important to share your content on Instagram (professional and personal) or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@modelmanagement.com?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> in order to interest new clients. But I don&#8217;t force myself at all because I always liked to share my life with people on the networks, I share my real life and maybe that&#8217;s what people like.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How to achieve permanence and constant growth on social networks (how to keep your followers interested and attract the attention of others)?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Publish every two days on social networks or at least 3/4 times a week. Never publish to publish, always publish quality content. Posting to post will make you lose commitment and your followers will feel it and no longer come to like/comment your posts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being too present by publishing every day will &#8221; burn out &#8221; your followers because by publishing every day your photos can&#8217;t be all qualitative and you will lose commitment. </span></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>How important are social networks for a model&#8217;s career today?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For me, social media is essential. The more you show yourself on the different networks, the more you will be contacted.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83814" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83814" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83814 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justine-social-media.jpg" alt="Personal Branding in Modeling" width="1080" height="1304" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83814" class="wp-caption-text">Model Justine Soranzo in Paris</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>“I don&#8217;t condone unnecessary malice”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Being exposed to such an audience means that a lot of people express opinions and judgments. How do you deal with this exposure and the compliments or criticism you may receive from your followers? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For my part, I am lucky because I am surrounded by a caring community. The people who follow me are people who love my work, my world, so there are no problems with them. As for critics, I very rarely have any. If I do, they are usually about looks and I don&#8217;t condone unnecessary malice, so I automatically block the person. People who don&#8217;t like my profile just have to go their way.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Throughout your modeling career, have you traveled a lot for your work? If so, what do you think about the inclusion of the Internet in the new way of doing (online) castings? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, I traveled a little for fashion week (catwalks) when I started out, in Milan and London but I have a profile that works very well in Paris. Being very homy, I like to stay in one place. So staying in Paris suits me very well. Traveling from time to time for pleasure is much better! After a while, I traveled within France or outside of France for certain jobs if brands wanted to shoot their collection in another country, and I love it because it feels like I&#8217;m going on holiday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Casting online is modern. I&#8217;m not in favor of casting by zoom or FaceTime, but online casting on platforms allows the client to have all our information at their disposal to make the final choice, which is much simpler.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83816" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83816" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83816 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Justine-bed.jpg" alt="Justine Soranzo Personal Branding" width="1080" height="1329" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83816" class="wp-caption-text">Model Justine Soranzo</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b></b><span class="s1"><b>You, who know the world of fashion and casting inside out, what do you think of a platform like ModelManagement.com? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think it&#8217;s a great concept. The client has access to our portfolio, our measurements, our polas, he has everything he needs to select the model he needs for a shoot. This is easy to use and makes it easier to book a model.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/william-de-haas/">William de Haas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM DE HAAS, 23 years old. Barcelona, Spain. </strong></p>
<p>William is a male model from Spain. He started his modeling career when he was 18 years old when at the 080 Fashion Show in Barcelona was scouted by Fifth Agency. From that moment his modeling jobs began to be more focused on fashion. Shortly after he was discovered by one of the most well-known agencies worldwide, he had an amazing opportunity: moving to China to work as a model. There he was featured in many international magazines such as Harper&#8217;s Bazaar and Vogue, and worked for some of the most important e-commerce campaigns. In this interview, he&#8217;s going to explain how to be a male model.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84283" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/william.3.jpg" alt="" width="794" height="1092" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your real name is Guillem Edo, why did you choose William de Haas as your artistic name?</h2>
<p>(laughs) &#8220;William&#8221; is the English translation of Guillem (in Catalan) and &#8220;de Haas&#8221; is the Dutch surname of my grandmother. I thought it was better to have a different name for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whoisthiswilliam/">social media</a> and my artistic work.</p>
<h2>When did you discover you wanted to be a model?</h2>
<p>My grandmother always told me I was really handsome (laughs) but I did not know I was capable of working as a model until I was 18. I started in a really small agency doing only one <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/">casting</a> per month but they were not related to fashion. Then I was featured in the 0<a href="https://www.instagram.com/080bcnfashion/?hl=es">80 Barcelona Fashion</a> show and I was scouted by <a href="https://www.5thmodels.com/">FIFTH models</a>. That is how everything started.</p>
<h2>What was your life like before that moment?</h2>
<p>I was not the best student at school but I managed to pass selectivity. Instead of going to the University, I decided to do a professional degree on marketing. However, after one year I needed a change of scene, I wanted to live new experiences and adventures and that is when I got offered to go to China to work as a professional model. Of course, I said yes! I will never regret that decision, to be honest.</p>
<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/morethanmodels/episodes/Introducing-More-Than-Models-by-ModelManagement-com-e11oa3r"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84261 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/banner-1200x-300-2.jpg" alt="" width="1208" height="311" /></a></p>
<h2>Wow, how did you get the offer to go to China to work?</h2>
<p>In my case, it was thanks to my agency and its contacts around the world. A scouter collaborator of FIFTH from Bilbao was sending models to work to different countries, but especially China because he lived there for a long time and knows how everything works. So he contacted me and offered me this opportunity. I was really curious about the country and everybody was telling me it would be a great experience, so I went.</p>
<h2>Are there any differences between working as a model in Spain and in China?</h2>
<p>I always say that there are many things that change when you are in China. First of all, the market. Chinese companies are looking for specific modeling profiles, you must have &#8220;the face&#8221; they need because they have their own parameters. Also when you go there to work you have to take into account the season, if it is  before or after Fashion Week, if it is in summer the competence will be higher than in winter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Also, is it true that you work many more hours in China?</h2>
<p>This is one of the biggest differences between European and Asian markets (laughs). The working culture in Asia is pretty different, it does not mean that it&#8217;s better or worse, just different. In China, the volume of jobs used to be higher, and the hours of work were also higher. Also, they pay you per hour, so the team will try to go as fast as possible with the shooting in order to save money even if it is the biggest company in China.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84278" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/william-2.png" alt="" width="872" height="1197" /></p>
<h2>What about the language? Do you speak Chinese?</h2>
<p>No, and this is one of the struggles as well when you go to work there because most of the people don&#8217;t speak English. The most important thing in these cases is that the agencies speak English because they will be the ones who manage your job and help you with everything you need. So while Chinese agencies speak English, things will be easy (laughs).</p>
<h2>So, do you have a manager always by your side?</h2>
<p>You always have the same drivers -even though they don&#8217;t speak English either- and they have the address with the Chinese characters you will never understand and they will drive you to the right place. Well, not always (laughs). I still remember the first time I went to China and from the airport, a driver picked me up because I needed to go to the hotel. He was waiting with a picture of me, not even the name, I got in the car and he dropped me somewhere I didn&#8217;t know so I was lost in China with those huge skyscrapers and I was just freaking out. I expected China as in the movies, more traditional, but then I realized this country is another shark. The important this is that in the end, after half an hour, I was able to figure out where to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84417 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2>It sounds like a fancy life, where you in a hotel or in a model apartment?</h2>
<p>First I stayed in a hotel because all the model apartments were fully crowded. After I stayed in a model apartment, but they are not fancy at all. They are too small when you want to put six people in there but they use to be in good areas, it always depends on the agency you are with. In my last two trips to China, I did not want to be in a model apartment because even though it was cool to be with <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/">other models</a> and through parties together when you become an &#8220;old dog&#8221; of the modeling industry (laughs) you want your own space and just chill.</p>
<h2>How is the life of a model in China?</h2>
<p>I used to feel like a superstar because people are taking you pictures in the street, they are super nice to you, want to be your friends, in the clubs you get free drinks&#8230; The lifestyle is different, you have more advantages than if you were a model in Spain because here we are all foreigners and in China being a foreigner, even if you are the ugliest guy in Spain (laughs), is something unusual.</p>
<h2>What kind of jobs do you get in China? Is it only local brands or also international?</h2>
<p>It depends on your luck, but it uses to be more local brands, most of all e-commerce. The funny thing is that if companies want to hire your services as a model, it does not matter if they are big or small brands because they will pay you the same. They pay models per hour, so you will always gain the same amount of money. Of course, there are exceptions, but when it comes to e-commerce, it is always the same.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84276" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/william-01.jpeg" alt="" width="938" height="1200" /></p>
<h2>But also European and American companies produce in China, right?</h2>
<p>Yes, they also like to work in China. During the hardest part of the pandemic, a lot of them went there to produce, I did a campaign for Adidas for example. I think it was due to the fact that in China we were able to stay in the streets without masks sometimes.</p>
<h2>What is the modeling job you most enjoyed doing?</h2>
<p>Half-year ago I did a Huawei campaign and it was really nice because we went to a desert near Mongolia to film. It was a long trip but it was worth it. The team was super nice, which is really important, and they also paid me a lot (laughs).</p>
<h2>After 3 years, what are you doing right now in Spain besides modeling?</h2>
<p>I am trying to learn how to manage my money, how to make it grow and how to invest in shares and stocks, and of course, the crypto world: bitcoins, ripple, cardano, etc. I am doing an online course about that and what I found out until now, at least in crypto, is that you need to be patient and avoid panic when things are going down.</p>
<h2>And you are also a singer, do you come from a musician family?</h2>
<p>Yes! My father used to sing in the best chorus in Catalonia, he traveled to many different places to do concerts. My sister is also a good artist, she is into astrology and she is trying to combine it with music. Right now I have two projects going on, related to music, but I can&#8217;t say anything about it yet. I am still in the casting process and I don&#8217;t want to snort it, so you will have to wait until it comes out &#8211; if it is does.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/sabela-alvarez-2/">Sabela Álvarez</a></p>
<p class="p1">Sabela Álvarez Cebrián is a Spanish doctor and fashion model. She was runner-up in the Miss World Spain contest and won the Miss World Barcelona contest. At the age of 17, she left her hometown, Palma de Mallorca, to study in Barcelona and fulfill her dream of <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/when-medicine-and-modeling-go-hand-in-hand/">becoming a doctor</a>. As a model, she has worked for brands such as Guess, L&#8217;Oreal, Revlon, Rosa Clará, and has paraded on several catwalks in Spain and Germany. Sabela defines herself as a resilient, responsible, optimistic, and hard-working person.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What motivated you to become a model?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m quite an artistic person: I&#8217;ve been playing the piano since I was a child, I like to paint… and I even did theatre. Modeling is another artistic facet that I am passionate about.</p>
<p class="p1">What started as a hobby, ended up being a profession. As I was studying Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, I could not afford to work in a fixed job with a daily schedule. That&#8217;s why fashion was great for me because I could do catalogs and sporadic photo shoots on weekends and some afternoons off. It was a way to have some financial independence, without affecting my studies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83994" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sabela-alvarez.png" alt="" width="811" height="1000" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>We understand that a career as a doctor takes up a lot of study hours. How do you combine your professional life as a doctor and fashion model?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">With a lot of discipline, effort, dedication, and, above all, time management. It is also true I was studying something that I am passionate about, so studying was really a pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What made you specialize in medicine, and what motivated you to go down this path?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">In addition to my medical degree, I have a degree in Biomedical Sciences. So my field is biomedical research. And more specifically, Molecular Oncology, where I finished my thesis a few months ago. I was doing onco-haematological research in Germany and I did a traineeship in New York. I have always liked the more &#8221;scientific&#8221; side of medicine. In fact, as a child, I wanted to be a scientist. I found in medicine the link between <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/the-art-of-connecting-passion-with-purpose-mariana-quiroga/">my passion for science</a> and my vocation to help others.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What is your motivation as a physician in a career that is currently very tough because of what is happening with covid-19?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">My main motivation, I suppose, is the same as that of other healthcare professionals: to fulfill our vocation. We spend almost half our lives training, so being able to put all this knowledge into practice and to translate it into being able to cure, to heal, or to save lives; motivates you to keep fighting.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>We know that you were working in hospitals during the pandemic. What was it like working as a doctor?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">Working on the front line of the battle against the pandemic has been and continues to be an extremely hard experience. The first few weeks were a great challenge, as we did not have adequate personal protective equipment and we were very afraid of contagion.</p>
<p class="p1">We barely used homemade plastic aprons that we made ourselves, double surgical masks, and gloves. There were no predefined protocols either, and all the doctors, from the youngest to the oldest, studied and learned every day because it was something new and little was known about it. Fortunately, now we have protective material, and every day we know more and more about the pathophysiology of SARSCOV2, but that does not mean that we are still working under a lot of pressure. Although most of our patients are people with comorbidities, we also have young patients.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What are you working on now and how do you see the situation in medicine?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">At the moment I combine emergency room duty for the Pandemic with my MIR preparation. All the doctors and the rest of the health professionals are very saturated. However, it is not all COVID19. There are still heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, and many other diseases&#8230; And it is very serious that surgical operations and other interventions are being canceled because of the current serious situation.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Do you think that your modeling career will accompany you throughout your life or will you stop working as a model to dedicate 100% of your time to your work?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">As long as I can combine it, I will continue to do so. It&#8217;s true that a modeling career usually dies at the age of 30, but the industry is getting more and more on diversity every day. We have learned that wrinkles are also beautiful, that more real and less &#8221;perfect&#8221; models empathize more with consumers, so now we can find models of all ages. On the other hand, medicine is very demanding, but I hope I don&#8217;t have to give up modeling 100%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83998 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sabela-1.jpg" alt="-doctor- fashion-model-sabela-álvarez" width="939" height="623" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>We know that you have always made a lot of references to your medical career during your modeling career. What message do you want to convey?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">The message I want to convey is that in life, with perseverance, discipline, and love for what we do, we can achieve all our dreams.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Do you think that being a model, in the media, in contests has helped your professional career as a doctor to make yourself known?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">Being a model has helped me to make myself better known. Not only myself but also my profession. So far <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sabela_alvarez/">my platform has been Instagram</a>, where I have been able to spread science and health. But I would love to be able to dedicate myself to the disclosure on TV, newspapers, and other digital media.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84396" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What would you tell someone who is just starting out in the modeling industry?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">I would recommend, first of all, learning and training. To be a professional model, first, you have to train yourself: learn how to pose, how to model depending on the type of show, how to act in front of the camera&#8230; and all that requires learning.  Being a model is born, but also made. The best models in the world have been to a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model-academy/">modeling academy</a> at some point in their lives. Training is essential.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-84000" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sabela-3.png" alt="fashion-model-doctor-sabela-alvarez-2" width="1000" height="792" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>And what would you say to someone who is just starting out in medicine?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">I would warn them that it is a very hard and very sacrificial profession that will take up a lot of their personal time. But if you still want to be a doctor, go ahead because it is a beautiful career. To take away someone&#8217;s suffering, a mother&#8217;s smile to cure her child or save a life is an indescribable feeling.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>You were on the verge of being the Spanish representative in Miss World, how was that contest?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">It was a great experience that I will always carry with me. In Miss World, unlike other beauty contests, they look for a complete and integral woman, so there are different tests. Besides being a finalist in almost all of them (&#8221;Artistic Talent Test&#8221; -where I played the piano-, &#8221;TopModel Test&#8221;, &#8221;Public&#8217;s Favorite&#8221;); being the Winner of &#8221;Beauty with a Purpose&#8221; &#8211; solidarity project, where I presented my personal involvement in the global pandemic COVID19: working on the frontline as an ER doctor, disseminated information regarding the coronavirus, answered doubts, raised awareness about the importance of preventive medicine through my social networks and supported the #yomecorono campaign not only by publicizing it but also by helping to raise funds-, was a great reward for my work and the most beautiful thing about the contest.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What did you like the most and the least?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">What I liked most was to use my impact as Miss to give visibility to the work of all health workers, to denounce the terrible conditions we initially worked in and to reaffirm our vocation and love for our work. Also the beautiful friendships I made; especially with my roommate, Romina, Miss World Bizkaia.</p>
<p class="p1">What I liked the least was that I fractured my foot in the Sports Test of the pageant. I went through a lot of pain. I knew that if I went to the hospital they would put my foot in a cast, put me on crutches, and therefore disqualify me. So I endured the suffering inside during the contest, with poise, elegance, and poise&#8230; I could not walk, I had a black foot&#8230;but with a good shot of corticoids and powerful anti-inflammatories, I walked and even paraded, with high heels!</p>
<p class="p1">I think about it today and I don&#8217;t believe it. Fortunately, as a doctor, I always take my first aid kit with me when I travel, just in case someone needs something, but I never thought that during the contest I would have to use it on myself, and even less so under these circumstances.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83996" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sabela2.jpg" alt="sabela-alvarez-fashion-model-doctor" width="794" height="1000" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Are they very strict with the physical aspect or do you think that talent is essential to be able to win these contests?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">Although a model and a Miss have to lead a healthy lifestyle, take care of their appearance and give an image; a model is a mannequin, so her physique must adapt more to the classic model profile or to the demands of the sector in which she works. To be a Miss is basically to be an ambassador for social causes, a representative of a territory, a person with oratory, artistic talent, and knowing how to be in different situations; so the physique, although it is important, is not so important. Above all, they look for health, avoiding underweight and overweight.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84417" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What motivated you to want to participate?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">The motto of Miss World is &#8221;beauty with purpose&#8221;, where they look for a complete and integral woman. Beyond physical beauty, we are looking for a woman with a social conscience, who has something to say and contributes to society. For me it was to take advantage of the influence that a beauty title generates, to be able to contribute something to society, especially to the most vulnerable.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>What did you learn from this experience?</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">I learned that unforeseen events and difficulties can arise in life that condition and harm you. We cannot control what happens to us, but we can control how we react to it. That&#8217;s why in life the most important thing is how we manage it. My motto is &#8221;In the end, everything turns out well&#8230; And if it does not turn out well, it is not the end yet&#8221;, which alludes to the fact that there is no evil that does not bring something good and that every day is a new opportunity to transform obstacles into a driving force to overcome them and to fulfill our dreams and goals.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>NINETTE SHIBARA</b></span><span class="s2">, 30 years old. Barcelona</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How to connect modeling with other professions is a question Ninette Shibara can answer. She is a pharmacist, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model</a> and much more, an energetic and tireless woman who proudly explains her lifestyle to us, in which she has been able to create a perfect balance between the time she dedicates to work and to her personal life. Ninette defends that modeling is accessible to everyone regardless of physical diversity or age.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Who is Ninette?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a positive woman and passionate about life, I am very open-minded, I like to experience everything I can and I feel very lucky, not by luck, but because all my effort has been worth it and everything has gone well for me. I am a person who lives life trying not to waste it. I avoid being bored or embittered. I live life to the fullest and try to transform mistakes and bad things that have happened to me into lessons.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83827" style="width: 709px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83827 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ninette-shibara.jpg" alt="Ninette-shibara-modeling-career" width="709" height="1063" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83827" class="wp-caption-text">Model <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/ninette-shibara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninette Shibara</a> by <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas vE</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2><span class="s1">And on a professional level, multifaceted&#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes! I like having more than one job. I studied clinical diagnostic laboratory, then I studied pharmacy and a postgraduate degree in phytotherapy because I really like medicinal botany. Many food supplements come from natural sources and nowadays people are more interested in natural medicine than ever. In addition, I also work as a model, among other jobs. I am a professional taster, I do product and food studies, and I am now specialized in almonds&#8230; It&#8217;s super fun.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">That&#8217;s incredible! How do you get time for everything?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My schedule at the pharmacy allows me to have free time every morning and that gives me a lot of freedom to do everything else. I have time to dedicate to my hobbies and be available for many jobs, especially modeling. Now I am learning to skate,</span><span class="s1"> embroidery and I have just signed up for a course in digital drawing and realism&#8230; When I am not doing any of this, I enjoy life because I love to enjoy my free time in the mornings. For me, it is very important to enjoy my personal life.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">An unusual professional lifestyle&#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes. I know that most people have only one source of income, but the pandemic has shown more than ever that any unexpected problem can always arise and change your professional life overnight… It gives me the security to have different sources of income, even though my main jobs are pharmacy and modeling.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">It seems that your head does not get much rest &#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Absolutely! In fact, I often have trouble sleeping (laughs). When there is something that I really like or I have a new project, I am unable to find the disconnect button.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">When did your modeling adventure begin?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I started as a model twelve years ago, before I got tattooed and I started the way I think a lot of people did: for no reason at all, just to have fun. My cousin was very fond of photography, he had good cameras and we started playing and taking photography. At age 22 my life changed radically. It was when I got the tattoo on my back when everything really kicked off. I did many collaborations, I did some nudes&#8230; I remember I started to put reduced rates because I was a beginner and I did not have much experience. I had always believed that I could not ask for a lot of money until I had developed well as a model. Eventually, I joined the @Suicidegirls community, which I had been following for years because I loved seeing those beautiful tattooed girls. I thought I would love to be like them… So I contacted the staff photographer and offered to collaborate. I took some photos with him and one of the photos got to different agencies that were interested in my profile.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">How would you describe your profile?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am aware that I do not have a conventional model profile, firstly because I am tattooed, secondly because I do not have the classic model measurements and I love how I am, but I am not the typical stereotype. I&#8217;m a business model, not strictly a fashion model, I&#8217;m not the typical mannequin.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;Thanks to modeling I have been able to regain my self-esteem one hundred percent.&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="s1">How has modeling influenced your life?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Very much. Before I was a girl with many insecurities. Thanks to modeling I have been able to regain my self-esteem one hundred per cent. In addition to all the nice comments I receive, I have also made super important changes in my life. In the past, after leaving a toxic personal relationship, I used makeup every day, I was wearing miniskirts&#8230; however, I have gone from worrying about my appearance and image to not thinking about it. I am a normal and ordinary person who when she works is a model, but outside of work she may not seem like it. Now I always wear a tracksuit, sneakers, a ponytail and glasses. I&#8217;m comfortable and I already feel very pretty like that and that was unthinkable years ago.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">Tell us about your spectacular tattoo&#8230;</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have always really liked tattoos. When I was 21 I started getting my back tattooed. I was fortunate to find a tattoo artist who advised me wonderfully and I will always be grateful for his advice. The drawing is very artistic because I have always liked art a lot. My father is an artisan jeweler and he likes to draw very much, he designed jewelry and made it at home. My tattoo is inspired by the painting “Job” by Alfons Mucha, a brand of cigars. In the drawing, I changed the paper from a cigarette to a bird because for many years of my life I felt like a caged bird. I felt like I had to get this drawing tattooed for many reasons.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">Can you tell us some of its meanings?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, right! It has many meanings: Modernism reminds me of my father because he was focused on modernist jewelry and because of our family history. I put a crown with jewels on the girl for my parents, some olive branches for my mother, who is from Andalusia. Also, the bird has feathers that end in the shape of two inverted hearts, related to the old sentimental relationship I had. The hand has a lot of prominence because it represents touch, which is a very special sense for me, as well as manual work, ceramics, cooking, embroidery&#8230; The expression on the face is between pensive and orgasmic, with eyes almost closed… I love my tattoo and it changed my life completely.</span></p>
<h2><span class="s1">How did you discover <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/">ModelManagement.com</a>?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I discovered ModelManagement.com searching the Internet for platforms for models and when I entered the platform I really liked it and I registered that same day. After a while, they were looking for ambassadors and they asked me for a video where I would explain my experience as a model. When I did it they liked it a lot and we continued to collaborate. Then, one day they asked if I was interested in doing a photo session with two more girls and I gladly accepted.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84417 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2><span class="s1">How was the session?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It went very well even though we were very different. I felt very comfortable and secure posing, I already had experience and the gestures and modeling itself are becoming more and more internalized in me because over time you learn everything. It is a process, nobody is born taught.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1">What would you highlight about the concept of ModelManagement.com?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It gives a lot of freedom and there are opportunities for everyone. I like the platform because you find a lot of variety and you can decide what to do and what not to do, and that is very important. I would also highlight the fact of being able to work online, not having to go to a place physically is an advantage, being able to do a casting from your home, for example, gives a lot of peace of mind and security. The digitization of this work is very cool because you can cover a wider range of opportunities without having to travel or waste time. That is why I think that Modelmanagement.com offers a great service because through my mobile I can show how I move, how I gesture&#8230; In addition, I really like that everyone has a place on the platform, without being marked by specific measures or fees.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;Anyone can be a model, there is a market for everyone, regardless of physique or age&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><span class="s1">What is your future in Modeling?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to dedicate myself to it for many more years. Maybe I will stop in 2023 because I have the dream of traveling around the world, I really love to travel. But the truth is that I think I will continue working for a long time because I have always known that I do not have the profile of a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/fashion/">fashion model</a>, but that I am a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/real-life-and-people/">commercial model</a>. I always tell people that <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/become-a-model/">anyone can be a model</a>, no matter how you are physically, because to be a model does not depend on your physique or age. If someone wants to make money as a model, they can. There are people who believe that if I gain weight I will no longer be able to be a model and that is not true, there is a market for everyone. This can be said for women who have children. In my case, I do not want to have children or get married, but it is important to emphasize that, continuously, because I am a woman, I am asked about this topic. I think there is life in the modeling world after giving birth, you can always get back in shape or find commercial modeling jobs regardless of your physique.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/emma-sung/">Emma Sung</a></p>
<p><strong>EMMA SUNG, 23 years old. Venezuela. </strong></p>
<p>Emma Sung is a young transgender model born in Venezuela who currently lives in San Sebastian. Despite being only 23 years old, she has lived through many difficult experiences that have led her to be the strong woman she is today. Through modeling she wants to give visibility to trans people and make this world a better place.</p>
<h2>Tell me more about yourself, who is Emma?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s a very good question. <strong>Emma is mainly confidence and strength</strong>. She is a person who had a difficult childhood, who had many experiences at a very young age and who has emigrated twice. <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/how-to-become-a-successful-international-model-rania-pugholm-left-egypt-to-conquer-the-world/">It is very hard to emigrate</a>, even though I moved to Chile with a friend it was not the same. Now in Spain I am with my family.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83623 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/emma-sung-interview.jpg" alt="young transgender model" width="1200" height="804" /></p>
<h2>However, you are from Venezuela. How long did you live there?</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Venezuela. I lived there until I was 19 years old.</p>
<h2>We all know the social and political context of Venezuela. What was it like growing up transgender in a country where you were living under a dictatorship practically since you were born?</h2>
<p>I started my transition in Chile. However, my family was already very sexist about this issue. Latin American and Venezuelan cultures are characterized by being more intolerant of these issues. In addition, I was bullied at school, and they tried to rape me when I was in high school. Kids bullied me from third to fifth grade, but my family didn&#8217;t even know about it. The teachers didn&#8217;t do anything about it either, and they made me feel that I was the one to blame for being the way I was. In the end, I ended up changing schools and in the new one, I didn&#8217;t have any bad experiences.</p>
<p>Since I was little I had to put up with comments from mothers at school who said &#8220;look what a <em>sissy</em> boy&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think children should listen to those kinds of comments. They saw me differently, I was always feminine regardless of my physique and since I lacked references, if they told me I was a &#8220;sissy&#8221; since I didn&#8217;t know what it was, I would say &#8220;well, I&#8217;m a sissy&#8221;. I had no references to identify how I felt.</p>
<h2>Have you held yourself back from being who you were?</h2>
<p>Yes. Since I had all these traumatic experiences at school or at home, I thought the same thing would happen to me on the street. And honestly, I have more traumatic experiences at school and at home than outside.</p>
<p>I had social anxiety. I felt like everyone was staring at me, my hands were sweating, I felt uncomfortable and I wanted to run away from places. I couldn&#8217;t leave the house without my headphones and my music, it was the way of isolating myself from reality. In Chile, I stopped feeling like that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83625 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/emma-sung-2.jpg" alt="Emma Sung trans model" width="1500" height="816" /></p>
<h2>This is very hard. You suffered bullying for 5 years, did you ask anyone for help at some point?</h2>
<p>Well, I went to psychologists. But mostly for my family, because they wanted to know what was wrong with me. In the end, nothing was wrong, it was just my personality and there was nothing wrong. I have been my own psychologist.<strong> I had a lot of mental strength</strong>. It was a very hard stage in which I had to put up with many problems at home, with my father. For many years everything was negative. But time heals everything and right now, it has already healed a certain part of it. We grow and learn.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;With modeling I had the freedom to be me, to be able to express myself, to talk to people without anyone judging me&#8221;.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>And at what point did you decide to be Emma?</h2>
<p>I always knew that Emma existed, but there were so many things I experienced that I unconsciously repressed. They made me identify myself with something I wasn&#8217;t, and I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t realize it until I went to Chile and started modeling. <strong>With modeling I had the freedom to be me</strong>, to be able to express myself, to talk to people without anyone judging me. At that moment, I thought about it and looked back. It was very shocking, I started to cry because I felt like a woman and I identified myself as a woman. I didn&#8217;t know what to do or how to start. Thanks to the industry, through friends, I met a trans guy who gave me advice, inspired me, and encouraged me to take the step. He made me realize that there were people who felt the same way I did and that it was possible.</p>
<p>At the age of 20, I had the courage to talk to my closest family and tell them what I was going through. In general, the reaction wasn&#8217;t bad, except for one or two family members who didn&#8217;t support me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83636 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/COLLAB-2.6.jpg" alt="model Emma Sung" width="3299" height="3347" /></p>
<h2>How did you get started in the modeling world?</h2>
<p>I started in the fashion world by chance. I am a very creative person and one of my dreams had always been to be a model, but I saw it as something far away. However, when I arrived in Chile, I started following Chilean show business and I got my first job when a photographer found me on the street. The project was for a Mexican magazine. At first, I was a little reluctant, because you know that in this world not everyone has good intentions, but I saw that a friend had already worked with him and I got the courage. This photographer offered me my first job and my first photoshoot to create my portfolio. Once there, through him, I started to meet more people and create connections. It was all very easy, really. The last job I did in Chile was for H&amp;M.</p>

<h2>Are you currently <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/become-a-model/">working as a model</a> or do you combine it with another job?</h2>
<p>In the beginning, I combined both. I worked as an operator from Monday to Friday and I always tried to work as a model on weekends. However, right now I&#8217;ve been in Spain for a year and with everything that is happening with Covid-19, it&#8217;s been difficult for me to work. Right now I want to find a job doing whatever I can and go back to modeling as soon as I can.</p>
<h2>What does modeling mean to you?</h2>
<p>The modeling environment is very frivolous, it&#8217;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/HclOq0v29MQ">very strict industry</a> with very specific requirements. However, for me it was therapy. I used to be a very shy person, a very self-doubting person.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83638 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/emma-sung-5.jpeg" alt="Emma Sung transgender model" width="1391" height="1184" /></p>
<h2>Do you use modeling to give visibility to transgender women?</h2>
<p>Through modeling you can make many issues visible, not only transgender women. At the end of the day you can transmit a lot with photographs. Despite being a cold world, it is a profession through which you can represent your emotions, yourself, society&#8230; I see it as a way to educate society.</p>
<h2>What is your next professional goal?</h2>
<p>I think I have something to contribute to the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/">modeling world</a>. I would like to work as a model on a recurring basis in Spain and do it internationally to be able to have a bigger audience and educate society, communicating the messages I want. I have also thought about studying fashion design to be able to achieve the same from the other side of the camera.</p>
<h2>What do you think about <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/">ModelManagement.com</a>?</h2>
<p>I think that <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/">ModelManagement.com</a> is very useful for all people in this industry, such as <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/">photographers</a>, stylists, makeup artists, etc, it&#8217;s not just for models. I think this <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographer/">platform</a> can help me start <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/">working as a model</a> more frequently in Spain. I am looking forward to it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>LAURENE MICHELET. PETITE MODEL. 23 YEARS OLD. FRANCE. STUDENT. </strong></p>
<p>Laurene is a nursing student and a Franco-British petite model. She started modeling when she was a teenager, however, she had to stop to focus on her studies. After some years, struggling with anorexia, she has decided to get back to modeling to represent petite models and empower other women like her, who think they cannot find their place in the industry.</p>
<p>Now she has done some editorials with magazines such as Picton, Yancee, Prime Magazine and her favorite, Horizont Magazine, and has worked with brands, such as Bourjois Paris and Fabletics. Today Laurene opens up to ModelManagement.com and explains to us how her road to modeling and empowerment has been.</p>
<h2>How much modeling experience do you have?</h2>
<p>I have been modeling for almost two years now. However, I also participated in some catwalks and photoshoots when I was 14 and I stopped because of my studies, but now I’m back to it!</p>
<figure id="attachment_83200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83200" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83200 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fQ.jpg" alt="petite model Laurene Michelet" width="900" height="1351" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83200" class="wp-caption-text">Photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/MarilyneSPhotographie/">@marilynesphotographie</a>, Jewels <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pijouletta/">@pijouletta</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>What empower you to become a petite model?</h2>
<p>I started when I was in England. I was approached by a swimwear brand and became an ambassador. Then I started working with different photographers and also some magazines. Some of them found me on Instagram and others on <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/">ModelManagement.com</a>, a go-to-platform to start modeling where there is a very big community of petite models around the world, and beginners can find the opportunity to progress. I’m very thankful for that.</p>
<figure id="attachment_83196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83196" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-83196 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MzM0IiwiZiI6ImpwZyJ9.jpg" alt="petite model with jacket" width="900" height="1364" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83196" class="wp-caption-text">Photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr_pix/">@gr_pix</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Have you encountered any challenges and difficulties?</h2>
<p>Yes, I had difficulties finding myself at the beginning because, this is something I’m going to say for the first time in public, but I suffered from anorexia for 7 years. It was very difficult for me to consider myself pretty and love myself, but modeling empowered me to take a step forward and start loving myself. Now I am a strong woman and model, and I want to help all women to believe in themselves. I also had difficulties getting an agency because I’m 5’2’’, a petite model,  which means I am not tall enough to become a high fashion model. However, recently I participated in a French modeling contest and I passed the two first selections. I hope to be in the final to finally prove that women who are 5’2 like me can be pretty too and can be represented in modeling.</p>

<h2>What has your best experience been as a model?</h2>
<p>I had a lot of great experiences and I’ve met a lot of nice people. But if I have to choose one, I will say the day I met the photographer and model Shirley Srv. Shirley is a lovely woman, she is a model and photographer, and she supports women’s rights and the body positive movement, just like me. I adore her and she is definitely my best meeting in the Modeling Industry!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>RICARDO MOSCOSO. Osuna (Andalusia), 45 years old.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ricardo Moscoso Camuñez is a fashion designer and also the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/fashion-stylists/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stylist</a> of some shootings that you will see in our series “<a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/category/model-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The person behind the model</a>”. With an intense background in the fashion world, we want to discover a little more about the person behind a tireless creator of art who, despite adversities, has never stopped working very hard for his <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/industry-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional</a> dream.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Your work transmits art, class, elegance and a lot of feminine strength… But who is Ricardo Moscoso?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ricardo is a very empathetic man, especially for the suffering of others, a very generous man, very altruistic &#8230; I even get emotional when I say it. I am a very, very rebellious man and at the same time, I have a lot of love to give. I consider myself very outgoing sentimentally. On a professional level, I avoid the superlative a lot, I know how much things cost and how difficult it is to achieve goals, and I am very down to earth. This is a very tough profession in which there is no support from the government.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How would you define your work?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my collections there is a lot of art, a lot of passion, a lot of Andalusia&#8230; I have felt very, very free since I was born, and I was born in a Spain that was not really as they wanted people to believe. People say that I take inspiration from one place and another. I don&#8217;t feel confined to borders, I came to this planet with a very great artistic sensibility. Osuna has a monumentality and one of the most important Renaissance complexes in the province of Seville. I was struck by its palaces, its facades, all the sacred art, that Holy Week with the velvet… Those gold headdresses… Where people saw pain I saw beauty.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;Women in my family are extremely strong and very feminine&#8230; Hence a part of my fashion concept&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How does fashion appear in your life?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It appears in a casual way. My paternal grandparents had a textile and clothing store in Osuna and a haberdashery. My father worked there. My mother is the youngest of seven sisters and together with the eldest one, they were seamstresses and dressmakers, so I already had contact with fabrics and patterns from a very young age&#8230; I grew up with the concepts &#8220;Long Chanel&#8221;, &#8220;Balenciaga Neck&#8221;&#8230; And I constantly asked myself who these people should be. And it is my grandmother Elena, through old photographs, who shows me the word “style”. She was very stylish&#8230; If there is something that fashion cannot buy, it is style, you either have style or you don&#8217;t. My mother and my six aunts were famous for their style and determination. They worked in the fields, in a very harsh Spain, but protected from the sun, protecting their white skin. They were extremely strong and very feminine… Hence a part of my fashion concept.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>So you&#8217;ve grown up among many women&#8230;</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I learned the important events of life from my aunts, super strong women, and I used to remember them with the clothes they were wearing. That is an observation that I have because no matter how much people say that women and men are equal, I do not see it that way. I have been brought up among super strong men and women and I know their language perfectly and I am very feminist. Even overly feminist. Women have that unique sensitivity. I have grown up with women with an exquisite education and know-how… And a lot of sense of humor. Because at the end of it all&#8230; We should die laughing! There was always a lot of laughter in my family, and there is still a lot of laughter needed in the world. You have to laugh a lot.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;I have never wanted to be the main protagonist of the film, </b></span><span class="s1"><b>but I did want to live it&#8230; &#8220;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How is your decision received in your family, as you say, in a harsh Spain?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it didn’t fit well that I want to dedicate myself to this, but in the end, I convinced them. Unfortunately, at that time, my father fell ill and passed away&#8230; All that was a setback for me, of course. I had to focus on my family, I helped my older brother get educated, he continued with the family businesses and when everything was fine again, they gave me the option of running with the business and I said no. </span><span class="s2">I wanted to fly… I wanted to belong to my time, I have never wanted to be the main protagonist of a movie, but I did want to live it…</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>And your new life begins in Ibiza&#8230;</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effectively. At the age of twenty-four, I moved to Ibiza to live and, without a doubt, they were the happiest years of my life&#8230; I had a very beautiful summer and met my husband. In Ibiza I was in charge of a multi-brand store and I had my first contact with international fashion brands. By chance, I discovered a fashion module which I entered and it was great. But I needed more and more… So I moved to Barcelona and started studying at the Escola Superior de Disseny i Art “Llotja”. That is where I continue my dream. Unfortunately, it was a very tough time on a personal and family level. </span><span class="s1">The tragedy crossed my path again and twice…</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>In a vital moment, life gave you a setback again&#8230;</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could not fully enjoy all that education because my personal situation robbed me of a lot of energy, I knew it would end badly&#8230; And I had to put myself to work to get ahead. I had to finish my final project, sometimes my teacher would come to see me at work to encourage me to go on and on&#8230; I didn&#8217;t know how, because for me that time was hell&#8230; And it wasn&#8217;t until 2017, almost ten years later, that I could finally finish my project. Life gives you blows and blows&#8230; All this, I have interpreted later thinking that, until then, it was not my moment. In 2017, suddenly, it was as if everything calmed down and, again, I had the option to take up what I left behind. I regained my strength and remembered that I had moved to Barcelona to make that dream come true. I got a very good grade for my project.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How was your final project?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the adversities, in less than two months I made an amazing Haute Couture with a story behind it&#8230; It represents Ibiza with the goddess Tanit, goddess of love, sexuality, goddess of dance, and of the night, that in fact is still being photographed&#8230; Mixing these two stories, creating the clothing, getting in touch with photographers, models, organizing the shooting, finding a certain location&#8230; It was really hard work. The week before the delivery of my final project I hardly slept. I did an exceptional job in record time, and that has to be said.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How do you manage so many adversities while you have to conserve energy to continue fighting for a dream?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are times when you feel like giving up. Because you can&#8217;t take it anymore, financially and personally it&#8217;s very hard. It is my vision of what I have lived. I&#8217;ve been through a lot of havoc. In my case, the support of four brothers has been fundamental, when they are rational, science and math people. The support of my friends, of Manuel, without him anything would not have been viable, when I no longer had faith he always pushed me forward&#8230; The fact that someone like Andreas trusts me&#8230; All this is brutal support.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Are you self-demanding?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Very much. When I see and analyze something I have done, I do not indulge in virtues. In any shooting I do, anyone else would say: &#8220;Very nice!&#8221;, &#8220;Very beautiful!&#8221;&#8230; But I look at the photos and analyze what is wrong, what could I do to improve&#8230; I am not competitive but I am very demanding of myself. I had a very strict upbringing, they were very progressive in my family, I have always been very anti-traditional and that has clashed a lot with the moral and social ethics of my town. Of course, I am a fan of Spanish culture&#8230; Goya, Velázquez, Gaudí, Balenciaga… They are the best. It is a shame that on a national level, Spain it is not committed to art&#8230; Being a country that exports so much of it.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;Haute Couture is absolute creativity without barriers&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is Haute Couture for you?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(He sighs) Haute Couture is the summon of fashion. It is absolute creativity without barriers. Haute Couture is to have the best fabrics, the most complex patterns, all the fashion mechanisms, the best top models, the best bodies, the best styles, the best photographers&#8230; Creating a piece of art. Haute Couture is art and only art. For me, fashion is Haute Couture. After Haute Couture comes the rest&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;Balenciaga should have a place in the Olympus of Spanish artists&#8221;</b></span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What pieces of art have impressed you the most?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was very impressed, in the Balenciaga museum in Getaria, with the color black, which is so deeply rooted in Spanish culture&#8230; The black in Balenciaga&#8217;s Globo line left me astonished. I spent two hours admiring the mannequin, because also, in digital, on one side you can see the pattern and you see how the piece breaks down, how the dress fits and assembles… I was amazed. I do not understand how this man does not appear in textbooks along with all those great geniuses that Spain boasts. He should have a place in the Olympus of Spanish artists. I was also very impressed by the white Chanel tailor, how minimalism and sobriety could not be more sophisticated, like a pure contradiction. Yves Saint Laurent&#8217;s tuxedo is a hymn to total culture, a message to the power of women. I like the red Valentino, I like the Métiers d&#8217;art collections by Chanel even more than Haute Couture&#8230; Haute Couture is a beast&#8230; And very, very classy, ​​too. And there is no choice but to define it that way. It is extremely elitist.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How would you describe the image of a designer?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to give an image of designers and fashion far removed from those ivory towers. I am not in favor of a designer having to be so well known from the media. That divinity they had in the twentieth century&#8230; For me it is too much, designers feel and suffer, we live and we have a story. I get off the pedestal alone, I need grounding. For me it is important, whoever wants to live it in another way, perfect. There is no licentiousness here, I have a very acute sense of ethics and justice.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Is fashion a coincidence?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes happens by chance, but, as Anna Wintour said, fashion has to be a reflection of the society you are living in.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What society are we living in?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a before and after in fashion with social networks, especially. Everything has changed. There are people who, thanks to the Internet, identify themselves with a brand or firm but do not even step on those stores. And that already tells you a lot about what is there and what will come. All that impersonalism will not end with Haute Couture, because the human being has the intrinsic need to feel different and to show the world his power. That hasn&#8217;t changed anything. What will change is the perception of power, but nothing else.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is behind a fashion collection?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If people knew what it is to create a collection… The process behind a collection, research, preparation, selection, hard work… Also photographic campaigns… Which photographer is going to take the photos with the specific message that I want to convey, who is willing to do it… Not everyone is willing to take transgressive photographs. Because they prefer to go to the elegant and basic that sells in the market. If my collection is not elegant or basic… You cannot take photos of it in a minimalist and basic style when I am claiming the sexuality of women. My latest “Erotica” shooting is a message to femininity, feminism&#8230; Everything has to be in tune.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_83123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83123" style="width: 1066px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-83123" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Valentina-perla.jpg" alt="Valentina-perla" width="1066" height="1600" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83123" class="wp-caption-text">Model <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/valentyna-rudenko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentina Rudenko</a> by <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas vE</a>.

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>When you say “That&#8217;s it. I have reached the top of my job&#8221;?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is something very complex in the minds of creatives&#8230; The most curious thing is that we never stop. When I am finishing designing a collection there is like a hurricane in my head, because at the same time that I am drawing, images come to me about how the shooting will be, where, I think about everything I will need&#8230; A collection is like a pregnancy, it is gestating, gestating&#8230; And when I&#8217;m in labor, instead of living the moment and taking a break, I&#8217;m already thinking about the next collection. It&#8217;s like there is something in me that is already bored with that and is already thinking about the following job. Through a shoe, a bow, an image, a collection… You jump to the next project. Creativity is a wheel that never stops&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>&#8220;I think we will return to a more classic method of fewer collections &#8230; Higher quality and less quantity&#8221;</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How do you see fashion today?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the one hand, fashion is becoming more and more democratized. The rhythms were very fast lately. Many great designers have fled from that beastly rhythm. It was not healthy and it was not possible, I think, to be preparing so many collections continuously… Now there has been a very big stoppage. I think we will return to a more classic method of fewer collections… Of higher quality and less quantity. I think there will be less but better. Everything has changed, even the parades, which have had to be presented online. The masculine &#8211; feminine concept is diluted&#8230; New age, new thinking&#8230; The issue of environmentalism or global warming is reflected in current fashion. Suddenly, the great firms that have always used natural fur are now opposed to all that. I have been observing the mechanism of fashion for so many years and I am hopeful about the future. But I cannot predict anything, I prefer to go from six months to six months&#8230; From collection to collection, but what is clear is that no one expected such a big change in such a short time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/photographers-find-models/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84365 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/banner-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How is the professional situation in your sector?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is very difficult. There are many unemployed designers, with very complicated and adverse situations in these times. It has always been difficult, but now, if you look closely, the collections that come are very safe colors and simple patterns. That tells you that there will be little movement. That there will be few buyers and that in the end it means less money. What if there are no weddings? The bride, the guests, nobody buys the dresses&#8230; And if they buy dresses, now they will spend much less&#8230; Big companies don&#8217;t die, they don&#8217;t lose, they just don&#8217;t earn that much. On the other hand, the aspirant is the one who suffers&#8230; It is really complicated. We have no help. Fashion is not cared for.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>“If I&#8217;m so good at this, why not say so?”</b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_83121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83121" style="width: 1066px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-83121" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ninette-espejo.jpg" alt="Ninette-espejo" width="1066" height="1600" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83121" class="wp-caption-text">Model <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/ninette-shibara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninette Shibara</a> by <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas vE</a>.

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>It must be very frustrating&#8230;</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course. Also, people always demand. And when they get tired of demanding it is because they have stopped believing in you. I keep pushing forward, but surely someone else would have already thrown in the towel in the middle of my journey&#8230; I don&#8217;t doubt my worth, it&#8217;s not narcissism, but I don&#8217;t doubt it. Stop limiting ourselves, let the whole world know. If I&#8217;m great at this, why not say so? What I doubt about is the system. Success doesn&#8217;t always depend on yourself. In my case, I have given everything, financially, personally, everything. There are times when I want to give up, but I don&#8217;t know how, I&#8217;m still pulling.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>If you had thrown in the towel, we wouldn&#8217;t be talking now, after your shooting with <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ModelManagement.com</a>…</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had already thought about closing the circle with my latest shooting “Erótikka”. But then I saw an ad from Andreas on a social network and I signed up. He contacted me and asked for nine looks. I took him fourteen, with only two days of preparation. I want to thank, among others, to those who always accompanied me from the beginning: Carmen @mikimono.barcelona, Beatriz <a href="https://www.instagram.com/secretosdealcobatocados/?hl=es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mikimono.barcelona</a>, Boris <a href="https://www.instagram.com/borislen/?hl=es">@borislen</a>, and my latest collaboration Enmanuel Grunstein <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grunsteinphotocinema/?hl=es">@grunsteinphotocinema</a>.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How was the session?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fantastic. I thank Andreas enormously for this opportunity, for me it is a small recognition of all the effort I put into this profession my entire life. I thank the whole team with whom I shared the shootings. The location, the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">models</a>, the team was awesome. Andreas gave me carte blanche in everything, he liked several pieces from my collection and he photographed them… I have to say that Andreas treated me with great affection. I have a lot of sensitivity, especially to detect people and characters. For my worth at a professional level I did not go with any type of complex, I was very calm, and Andreas was a gentleman, very warm. He respected my work a lot, he let me do everything I wanted to contribute. It was a close treatment, like the ones I like. He is a man with a great business career and a man very interested in arts that gave me a lot of warmth. In the shooting, everything flowed very elegantly and very well despite all the stress that a shooting has. A great experience.</span></p>

<p><strong>Photographer:</strong> <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography">Andreas vE</a>.<br /><strong>Model:</strong> <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/paula-collado/">Paula Collado</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PAULA COLLADO</strong>. 22 years old. Actress, model, dancer and graduate in tourism.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paula is a delightful, friendly and cheerful girl. Her sweet and kind nature shines through and it is often quite difficult to get through a conversation without smiling yourself. Yet, she is also brave, persevering and admits that she worked hard and dedicated a lot of time to be able to find a place in the world of modeling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multifaceted and a tireless dreamer, she relishes a challenge, objectives and is grateful to fashion for all that it has taught her in these years and the great memories and experiences she has. In her dream of becoming an actress, she highlights the importance of creating a wonderful portfolio thanks to her work in fashion. With all her passion, experience and values, Paula Collado is our fifth protagonist of the series &#8220;<a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/category/model-portraits/">Person behind the model</a>&#8220;.</span></p>





<h2><strong>Who is Paula?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One never really knows how to answer this question, but I would say that I’m a very happy and active person, and always up for challenges. My family and friends mean a lot to me and I love to spend time with them. Another trait of mine is that I can be very emotional and have been known to have “drama queen” moments. However, I look at this positively as I think it is where my passion for acting comes from, I enjoy expressing and exploring my emotions, for me it’s as fun as an amusement park (laughs).</span></p>



<h2><strong>Besides acting, there are many other passions in your life &#8230;</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I like to do many things&#8230; I studied tourism at university, and I’ve been working as a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/">model</a> since high school. I was able to find a true passion when I had a moment of introspection and began to study theater and it was great, it saved my life. After university, my parents didn’t feel happy about me working in theater professionally, so completed a master&#8217;s degree in event management. I thought I could dedicate myself to fashion and cinema events or galas&#8230; So right now I organize congresses while also working as a model and creating my video book. Currently, I have to admit that the modeling work flows more, I’m involved in many projects. I suppose it is easier than finding someone who trusts you to give you a role in a movie or a series…</span></p>

<h2><strong>How did you become a fashion model?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember that when I enrolled in my first <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model-agencies/">agency</a> I would drop by the office every Friday in order to book jobs. It was a bit of an effort to get there as my agency was in Barcelona and I live Sabadell, which is two hours away. Despite that, I was very excited and I knew how important it was for the bookers to keep me in mind so every time a project came up they would send me the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/castings/">casting</a>, session or whatever. What I wanted was to gain experience and consistency.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84396 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My drive and attitude are what helped me get castings and jobs with brands, even though I didn’t always the predetermined requirements. There may be people who have the exact and perfect measurements and don&#8217;t get a job because they don&#8217;t have consistency or a good attitude. I achieved many things because every day I spoke with my booker, I insisted a lot&#8230; He also looked for collaborations, I volunteered for any brand or photographer who wanted to take photos of me, friends who studied design&#8230; Anything to gain experience, to work as hard as possible, and to build up confidence in front of the cameras. Therefore, when I had an important casting or a great opportunity in front of me, I would have the necessary tools to be able to present myself and be the one selected. </span></p>

<figure id="attachment_81774" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81774" style="width: 1333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-81774 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1.jpg" alt="Paula_Collado_professional_shooting" width="1333" height="2000" srcset="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1.jpg 1333w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-2-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81774" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/paula-collado/" rel="nofollow">Paula Collado</a> by Andreas vE</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Today, social networks have a very important role in fashion</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Absolutely. And a good attitude is the key to all of this. It is very important to make yourself known, dedicate time to it and send material&#8230; Let people know that you are there. In the end, you have to realize that an agency receives heaps of applicants, but it is up to you to gain the booker’s trust and attention. This is how the industry works, you need to make yourself visible, be tireless, always be in contact with the people who can help you, know your objective and what interests you, always be available for projects and be very proactive… You should go for what you really want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great advantage is having a video book or material already prepared, it helps to take charge when looking for collaboration projects, move around a lot and provide the agency with material so when the time comes to present you they have great content. Really, it&#8217;s incredible the projects that come when you are active and take control. What you seek, you eventually attract. It may seem difficult at first, but once you focus and move with intention, it starts to get easier.</span></p>



<h2><strong>Why do you think Andreas thought of you for his series “Person behind the model”?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is that during the session I realized that he had captured very well the points that interested him about me. With him, I found a photographer who captures the art of a person, not only external beauty but the internal too and knows how to get the most out of each model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I used to dance ballet but I stopped two years ago when I went to Argentina for Erasmus, there I learned more about Latin dances, such as reggaeton. So when I was asked to dance during the shoot, at first it was difficult as I hadn’t practiced ballet for quite a long time, and the minutes seemed to pass like hours despite having danced all my life. I told Andreas that I could dress like a dancer, of course, because that is what I have always done, but I warned him that my flexibility wouldn’t be the same as I hadn’t trained. However, as soon as I started dancing, I understood why Andreas had chosen me. I regained a part of myself that I hadn&#8217;t felt for a long time&#8230; and I loved every moment, it was so liberating. He told me, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put on the music and you just enjoy it.&#8221; I’m usually very strict with myself, but the fact that Andreas gave me the freedom, I understood that the project was in my hands and from that point, magic arose. The chemistry created in this project was incredible, I really enjoyed working with Andreas and the space he gave me to be myself.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_81778" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81778" style="width: 1333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-81778 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6.jpg" alt="model_portraits_paula_collado" width="1333" height="2000" srcset="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6.jpg 1333w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paula-collado-6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81778" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/paula-collado/">Paula Collado</a> by Andreas vE</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>



<h2><strong>What influence does ballet have on you when you are in front of a camera?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a curious question because people who have seen me, both in theater and modeling, see the ballet in my movements. This is due to the enormous influence that ballet has physically, the immense body intelligence you pick up. Every single muscle is working, even the small ones that you don’t know exist, but this precision is what brings perfection. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without a doubt, ballet makes you know every corner of your body and that is very important when you are a model or actress because, in the end, your body is your working instrument.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, in ballet, you always dance for an audience that watches your every move. The theater is the opposite; it is more of an internal representation. The theater allows you to take on a character, then express and bring out parts that you wouldn’t feel comfortable showing as yourself. Theater is like therapy, it can change people, it has definitely helped me understand the importance of taking care of myself internally. </span></p>



<h2><strong>You mentioned the magic that was created in the studio. How can the connection between model and photographer influence a shoot?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is fortunate to find chemistry between the two, a great advantage as a model as everything flows easily. However, if you don’t find that connection with the photographer, you should just be professional, analyze the shoot and focus on connecting with the camera.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why is it hard to believe that a beautiful person can also be very intelligent?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, this is something I have always been very against. I have been taught since I was little that beauty is something that is carried on the inside. I really believe in this, some of the projects that I got as a catwalk model, I did not get them solely for the way I looked but it was more a question of connection and intelligence. I have always tried to show that I am more intelligent than beautiful. Because for me, to be beautiful is to be intelligent, it is to have something inside that can contribute some good to the world. To be beautiful is to have a good and striking personality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, advertising is focusing on issues more related to the special personality of a person than their physique. Advertisements, photos… evolve a lot and are increasingly featuring super authentic people. Being handsome or pretty is subjective, and in my opinion, it depends a lot on the personality of the person. I think that brands are trying more to fit in with society through values.</span></p>



<h2><strong>What are the fundamental values ​​for you in life?</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For me being respectful, trustworthy, humble is super important… and being persistent. The value of effort has always been taught in my household. For example, a subject that was very difficult for me in school was physics, I tried very hard but failed. On the other hand, my twin brother used to pass without even trying! Despite that, my parents’ would be angry with him, as they felt that it was the effort that mattered, and they have always rewarded me for the energy I put into everything. Being a good person is also a fundamental value, of course. I grew up with my grandparents and they have taught me the value of having a good heart, good intentions, taking care of others, and loving a lot.</span></p>

<h2><strong>If you are a good person you end up attracting the good</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When someone is envious or treats you badly, I think it is because they are suffering and that is why they express themselves that way. I like to help these people rather than running away from them. Obviously, if they shield themselves, there is no choice but to just join the good guys.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world of fashion has very good elements, but also somebody parameters that I do not fit into, otherwise, it would have been my main career path. But it really brings a lot of values, I had to get to know many people in a day or two and fashion teaches you to connect and be tolerant because many times you don&#8217;t know anyone from the team you work with, as well as how to adapt quickly to situations and fit in as well as possible.</span></p>



<h2><strong>Complete the sentence: Your dream is&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being an actress, without a doubt. I know the road is complicated, but it is very clear to me. If in the end, it is not possible, I would love to organize big events. My first and main dream is to be an actress and I want it more and more every day.</span></p>
