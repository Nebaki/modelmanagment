										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May is <strong>Mental Health Awareness Month</strong> and from <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/">ModelManagement.com</a> we wanted to talk about this and encourage people to work on their Mental Health. Specifically, since models are constantly exposed to rejection, we focused on rejection and mental health in the industry.  Because all <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/">models</a> have been rejected at least once. Rejection is something common within the modeling industry, but of course, some models, especially aspiring, still take it as a personal problem. Sometimes we don&#8217;t take into account how people might get affected by this so we decided to put together some testimonials to talk about it under the hashtag <strong>#IWasRejectToo</strong>.</p>
<h2>What is the Meaning of Success?</h2>
<p>First of all, we decided to ask some professional models what was their concept of success, as this is what might lead to think &#8220;I am not successful enough to be in it&#8221;. Which are the milestones to take to be a successful professional? Different models answer these questions from diverse perspectives and teach us that, at the end, success is personal, and your attitude is essential to become successful.</p>

<h2>The Fear of Rejection</h2>
<p>Models attend many castings, and they eventually get rejected, so everyone who wants to be part of the modeling industry needs to be aware that is a part of the journey and that <strong>it doesn’t define how good you are</strong>. For this, we reunited 13 professional models who were rejected too. In this video they share their experiences about being rejected by modeling agencies, casting directors, etc. They also explain how they got over the fear of rejection and give some tips to aspiring models.</p>
<p>Models who appear on the video: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/rebecca-pace/">Rebecca Pace</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/angelika-dela-torre/">Angelika dela Torre</a>, Alejandro Balaguer, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/pablo-felix-2/">Pablo Félix</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/alicia-duran-rodriguez/">Alicia Durán</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/jamy-1/">Jamy</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/nadin-m-clofen/">Nadin Muñoz</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/nini-amerlise/">Nini Amerlise</a>, Luana Giorgio, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/sura-uysal/">Sura Uysal</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/rita-cabassa-guimaraes/">Rita Cabassa</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/masha-syta-1/">Masha Syta</a>, and <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/shany-black/">Shany Black</a>.  The aim of this video is to normalize rejection and encourage aspiring models to <strong>not give up</strong>.</p>

<h2>Rejection on Social Media</h2>
<p>We did an Instagram Live with the model and influencer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/imbrigita/">Brigita</a>. Besides having vitiligo, a skin condition in which some patches of skin lose color, she is also a plus-size model. Brigita has dealt with not-so-positive comments on social media, but that has never stopped her from pursuing her modeling career.</p>

<h2>How to Reject Someone Nicely</h2>
<p>Professionals are usually looking for a very specific profile and not everyone fits the characteristics. However, it is not easy to reject someone and tell them they aren’t selected. In this video, we reunited Marzenka Kwintera a professional published photographer; Nini Amerlise, model and agency director, and Heidi Gretel Meza, an HR and Mental Health expert. They will explain how to reject someone nicely and their criteria on how they do it.</p>

<h2>Mindfulness for Models</h2>
<p>Self-love and confidence are essential to have a good and positive attitude towards rejection in modeling. Models need to take care of themselves, not just physically, but mentally. For that, we arranged a Mindfulness x Models Live session through Instagram with our ambassador <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silvermodel_rita/">Rita</a>. She answered some of the most popular questions about rejection and mental health, and gave some tips on how to be mentally prepared for a casting experience.</p>

At ModelManagement.com, we believe everyone can be a model, and for that reason, we created these series on Rejection and Mental Health. You must take into account that rejection is part of the industry and you can&#8217;t take it too personally. Sometimes you are not what professionals are looking for in a specific project, and that is all. You must keep working hard because someday you will get a YES. And if you want to get ready for that huge opportunity, keep going and try the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-academy/">Model Academy, </a>where we will teach you everything you need to know about the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The digital age has advanced and expanded job opportunities in every industry. To get scouted now in the modeling industry, technology has allowed models and professionals to promote themselves through social networks and platforms such as ModelManagement.com to find work and promote their projects.</p>
<h2 class="p1">How to get scouted in the Modeling Industry?</h2>
<p class="p1">In order to stand out in the modeling industry today, it is very important to take care of your <strong>personal branding</strong> and be very consistent in all the promotional opportunities we have. In the past, it was important to go from agency to agency to be able to show your profile, work, and be known, but now with technology, you are just a click away from letting people know who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Social networks are a good tool to show your work and make your profile known. However, it is important to keep in mind that anyone can create an account and impersonate someone else. For this reason, use social networks primarily <strong>to give voice to what you do</strong>, follow professional&#8217;s verified profiles, and keep up to date with everything that is happening in the industry, this way your chances of getting scouted will increase.</li>
<li>ModelManagement.com is the easiest and safest platform to make yourself known and meet other professionals with the assurance that their profiles are real. The platform allows you to apply to castings for modeling agencies, photoshoots, or projects where models are needed. In addition, you can contact these professionals through direct messages and build your professional network there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83343 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/work-from-home-modeling-jobs.jpg" alt="how-to-get-scouted-for-modeling" width="1500" height="1000" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modeling industry has also expanded job opportunities by creating online projects or virtual photoshoots. From the perspective of a professional model, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/nadin-m-clofen/"><strong>Nadin M. Clofen</strong> </a>tells us about her experience working for a vision/machine learning project where they scouted different models and profiles to create software that would detect the face of these people during the day. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My job was to take pictures of myself for four days with different outfits. I took pictures of myself in selfie mode, with the phone&#8217;s rear camera, during my day-to-day life: practicing sports, reading, smiling, having a coffee, sitting down&#8230; The truth is that it has been quite a curious experience.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many models are trying this new way of working, Nadin says that it was her first time and that she would do it again. &#8220;It has been a different experience. I hadn&#8217;t considered the option of working online as a model until the opportunity arose. When you work as a model, you work with your image and offer it to be photographed. In my case with this project and thanks to the advances in technology and the quality of my phone, I was the one taking the pictures. I would definitely repeat the experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-83347 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nadin-work-from-home.jpg" alt="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/nadin-m-clofen/" width="2316" height="3088" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of safety in these online projects also plays an important role. &#8220;I only accepted it because it came through <strong>ModelManagement.com</strong> and I knew it was a <strong>real job</strong>. If it had been sent to me by e-mail or social networks I would not have accepted it. These job offers are good opportunities to work, increase projects and earn extra money, but you have to be sure of the offers you accept.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84417" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing to carry out this style of projects once you have been scouted is <strong>communication with the professional</strong>, Nadin says. &#8220;In these online projects, it is important to know what the client is looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to obtain the desired result</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What material the model needs to have at home, what the goal of the project is, what kind of results the client expects, are some of the questions to keep in mind.&#8221; In addition, ModelManagement.com offers the possibility to talk to the professional through the platform in a private chat to ensure that everything is safe and written in one place.</span></p>
<p>According to the importance of communication, knowing the full vocabulary of the industry is essential to ensure that you understand all terms and conditions of the job. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/learnmatch/?hl=es"><strong>LearnMatch</strong></a> is the perfect tool to learn the vocabulary in a fast, simple, and fun way. <a href="https://learnmat.ch/MM-purchase-global-97">Download the app now</a> on your phone, improve your English in the industry at any time, and take a step further in your modeling career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any aspiring model, at the beginning of their career, dreams of getting signed to a modeling agency that will bring a successful career. However, being signed by an agency is not the only way to work as a model and it does not necessarily mean that your career is going to be a success. It is common that the most popular models are represented by an agency. This is why finding an agency is one of the top priorities of aspiring models. In this post, we are going to reveal <strong>5 important facts about modeling agencies</strong> you need to know before signing to one. Take notes!</p>
<h2>1. Meaning of working with an agency</h2>
<p>Before making this decision, it is essential that aspiring models know exactly what it means to be represented by an agency. Modeling agencies work to find job opportunities for their models. Once the model is selected for the job, the modeling agency takes care of all the paperwork needed, such as agreements, contracts and payment. In exchange for all the work they do on the model’s behalf, they take a commission of the initial payment, which is usually around 20%,  but it will depend on the country.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-83175 size-full" title="modeling-agencies-5-facts-you-need-to-know" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pexels-cottonbro-4273370.jpg" alt="modeling-agencies-5-facts-you-need-to-know" width="3500" height="2333" /></p>
<h2><strong>2.   </strong><b>No payments needed</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding money, you have to know that it is not usual that the agency asks the model for money. </span><b>The money the agency gets is from the model’s commissions, period</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Otherwise, you may be being scammed. –­– </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend you to check our</span></i><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/safety-and-trust/"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety &amp; Trust page</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where you can find more information</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about scams, fraud, and tips on how to stay safe.</span></i></p>
<h2>3. Specialized agencies</h2>
<p>When you are trying to find an agency to represent you, you have to take into account that not all agencies seek the same types of models. Actually, it is common that modeling agencies are focused on a field, whether it is high fashion, commercial, talents agency, plus-size, or kids.</p>
<p>In this case, you will have to inform yourself of all the different options available to find your modeling discipline or talent. Once you know what type of modeling you want to do, you will have to find the right agency. This can take you some time, but it will be definitely worth it. –– <em>You can find all the information about modeling types in the first chapter of the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-academy/">Model Academy</a> which you can access for free!</em></p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-83166 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pexels-pixabay-209948-1.jpg" alt="modeling-agencies-5-facts-you-need-to-know-dancers" width="4288" height="2848" /><br />
4. You might not get jobs either</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, signing with a modeling agency does not necessarily mean you&#8217;ll get hundreds of jobs. In any case, it is important you know what it means exactly to <strong>sign exclusivity with an agency</strong>. Exclusivity can be local or international and it is an agreement between the model and the agency where the model commits to only work with that agency in a specific territory –as mentioned before, it can be local or international. Exclusivity could be a good option for the model if the agency really tries to find jobs. However, if your modeling agency fails to do this, exclusivity can be a barrier to take on other projects you might be interested in.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84396 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2>5. Payment can take some time</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest: when we are working, money is one of our top motivations, there is nothing wrong with admitting it. You may adore your job, but you are doing it for a living, so money is important.</p>
<p>When you are working through an agency, payments can take longer than expected, and longer means many days. Payments through modeling agencies can take on average from 30 to 120 days. It will depend on the country you are working in and how fast the client pays the agency.</p>
<p>These were 5 facts about modeling agencies every aspiring should know. However, remember that working through an agency is not the only way you have to start your modeling career. ModelManagement.com offers you <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/">thousands of job opportunities</a> from your pocket and you can use it even if you’re signed to an agency ––as long as you don’t have an exclusivity agreement. At ModelManagement.com models manage their careers at 100% and there are no commissions, which means the model receives the entire payment.</p>
<p>Besides, many modeling agencies around the world seek new models to sign to through ModelManagement.com, so <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/account/sign-in/">create your account</a> and open up to the modeling world!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We would like to discuss today a controversial subject that we think many models and <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-academy">aspiring models</a> might be super interested in. Since we&#8217;re living in a world that&#8217;s constantly evolving and the old values are replaced by new trends, the question of having a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/ranking/coolest-tattoo-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tattoo</a> (or several) as a model arises. It&#8217;s nothing against the law to have a tattoo and still be able to model.</p>
<p>There are a lot of models that have tattoos and are successful at their <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job</a>, nowadays there are even models who get <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling jobs</a> thanks to their tattoos! But I would still advice you to choose something small and have it done in a place where you can hide it or where it&#8217;s not too visible.</p>
<p>For <strong>catwalk models</strong>, things could change as there are a lot of designer houses that don&#8217;t accept <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models with tattoos</a>. It&#8217;s just because sometimes the tattoo you have, might not go with the fashion style they represent, it all depends on the brands you work for.<br />
If you decide to have a tattoo and then regret it, you can always have it removed. With today&#8217;s technology everything is possible! But I would recommend thinking twice before you decide to take the step and visualise what you want from your modeling career, so you won&#8217;t be sorry about it later.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some tips to creat your own social community!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the World of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media</a>, pictures, friends and &#8220;likes&#8221; are becoming more and more important.  Connections are not only made to be in contact with others but to build up a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social community</a> which can give you support on your success in social networks.</p>
<p>How can you build up your own social community on <a href="https://instagram.com/modelmanagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>?</p>
<p><strong>1. The Power of Likes</strong></p>
<p>Like as many pictures as you can and follow many people with your same interests. As soon as you break the ice with a kind like on other profiles they will start to check your account and reply back.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IG-likes-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1707" height="2560" /></p>
<p><strong> 2. Show some interests!<br />
</strong>Ask a question in the caption of your post and create a buzz under your picture. Posts which end with a question give the chance to your followers to share they own thoughts.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;How was your day?&#8221; , &#8220;Do you like my <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outfit</a>?&#8221;, &#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221; &#8230; </em>and the comments flow has just started.</p>
<p><strong>3. Quality beats quantity<br />
</strong>Don&#8217;t share random photos of you and even don&#8217;t do it all day. If you want to build up a succesful social community, you need to keep in mind that quality is way more important than quantity. You want to look <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional</a> on social networks as well, right?</p>
<p>Then create your posts prudentially!</p>
<p><strong>4. Use tools to get the most out of Instagram</strong></p>
<p>You are able to find many applications which help you to manage your account like a Pro. There is one called <a href="https://www.piqora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piqora</a> which helps you to see which kind of photos are the most successful on the platform. After you realize what pictures your followers are interested about, the only thing you need to do is upload more of them.</p>
<p>Another application, called <a href="https://www.latergram.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latergramme</a> which is also very useful. Creating great posts and pictures take so much time every day. This app helps you to schedule your post some days before the publication. What a good one, right? In this way, you have time to make posts some days before just in case you are busy.</p>
<p><strong>5. Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Use an image and tell a story with it.</p>
<p><em>Why is that picture important for you? What happened during the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/i-need-professional-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a>?</em></p>
<p>Create some emotional backgrounds for your picture and let your followers get to know you a bit more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/storytelling-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The height question is one that we hear often in the fashion industry and, believe it or not, it is one of the biggest misconceptions stopping lots of potential <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models</a> from having a successful career. Success in the Modeling Industry is possible, regardless of how tall you are.</p>
<p>Whilst there is no doubt that catwalks require more often taller and slender figures, recently, following the boom of the personality cult, blogs, &#8216;It girls&#8217; and bloggers, we have seen lots of<a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/ranking/best-petite-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> petite models</a> on the rise – as well as celebrities! &#8211; who despite their height have managed to become a tall order in fashion.</p>
<p>Who? You ask. Here we bring you some fabulous, stylish and very inspiring examples.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because you are worth it”</p></blockquote>
<p>Desperately gorgeous petite actress and <strong>model Eva Longoria (about 5&#8242; 2&#8243;)</strong> joined the towering<br />
supermodel heights of Claudia Schiffer (5’11&#8243;!) starring – Just like Claudia &#8211; in countless of <strong>L’Oreal ads</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gy8b77VW1qc" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>… and it isn’t just L’Oreal that Eva sold us, but lots of other super brands too like: <strong>Hanes, Heineken, Magnum, Microsoft’s &#8220;I am a PC&#8221;</strong> campaign as well as campaigns for <strong>London Fog</strong>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia reports that based on her earnings within June 1, 2009 to June 1, 2010 Longoria was ranked No. 4 on Forbes Prime Time&#8217;s 10 Top-Earning Women. Not bad for a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/ranking/best-petite-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">petite girl</a> huh?</p>
<p>Whilst there is no doubt that supermodel <strong>Rosie Huntington Whiteley</strong> is a knockout and that she looks absolutely stunning in all her <strong>Agent Provocateur ads</strong>, to date, no supermodel can beat Agent Provocateur’s number one viral advert, starring the goddess that is <strong>Kylie Minogue (at 5’1&#8243;!)</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wd5KajxGhs" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most stylish and cool girls States side &#8211; muse to <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/industry-professionals/fashion-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designers</a> and adored by bloggers and the creative fashion/art crowd alike &#8211; is the gorgeous blogger/model <a href="https://lookbook.nu/olivia">Olivia Lo</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming an Instagram Influencer Model can vary depending on your audience, but before we get into what a Model Influencer is, let us tell you how a brand like <a href="https://www.alpecin.es/?utm_source=mm&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mmblogpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpecin</a> found the perfect influencers to promote their product. <a href="https://www.alpecin.es/?utm_source=mm&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mmblogpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpecin</a> decided to <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cast models</a> exclusively on <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModelManagement.com</a>, why? <strong>Because we have over <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">275K models</a> on our platform, can you imagine how many of them are influencers?</strong> <strong>Thousands!</strong></p>
<h4><strong>How can a brand reach the perfect ambassador for Social Media?</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.alpecin.es/?utm_source=mm&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mmblogpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpecin</a> is Germany&#8217;s Number One Male Hair-care Brand.</strong> The Shampoo contains a Caffeine-complex that helps to prevent hair-loss. The brand is famous for innovative advertising, for example in Germany, where they launched a campaign that claims their Caffeine Shampoo to be Doping for the hair.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve launched their brand in Spain and decided to use female influencer models with lots of male followers to increase the awareness of their product. The special idea of this campaign is that each model was asked to create an individual social media campaign including the video and photo production to make sure that the message fits to their audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-84417 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/banner-modelos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We were blown away by this innovative campaign concept and asked one of the selected models <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/eva-padlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Padlock</a> about her life as an influencer model and specifically about her experience with this unique project.</p>
<p><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/eva-padlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Padlock</a> is a Spanish model, known as a &#8220;Monster Girl&#8221;, one of the models promoting the Monster drink at all international Moto GP races. She is considered an Instagram influencer, and surprisingly she has only been in the social media world for four years now, yet she has achieved so much in so little time! What&#8217;s the key to her success?</p>
<figure style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/eva-padlock-photos.jpg" alt="foto-de-eva-padlock" width="489" height="744" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spanish Model Eva Padlock</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What is an Influencer and how did you become one?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, I don’t really know how I got so many followers, but what is actually rewarding is that a lot of people get in contact to thank me for making them smile and I have conveyed something positive just through my posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You currently have more than 1.7M followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/evapadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> alone, what has been the main reason you&#8217;ve gained such notoriety within social networks?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the sensual images I usually post, I think that when you’re fulfilling goals and accomplishing things that initially seem impossible, people appear to value this. I have been in the social world for barely a year and a half and I never imagined changing my job and spending most of the time traveling. You’re full of illusion when major brands from the fashion world want to collaborate with you. Actually, I’m living a dream.</p>
<figure style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/evaP.jpg" alt="Eva-Padlock" width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Model Eva Padlock</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Congratulations on your Instagram campaign for <a href="https://www.alpecin.es/?utm_source=mm&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mmblogpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpecin</a>. You’ve been the creative director and the main <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model</a> of the video! How did you decide on the concept to express the right message to your followers?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was an interesting project because I could develop my role as an interior designer, when choosing a location, organizing and shooting a series of shots in a given space; it was interesting to merge my old job with the current one as a model and create a story according to what the customer demanded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For some time now we’ve seen a change in the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling industry</a> where more and more atypical models are reaching success in the market. Do you consider yourself an atypical model? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I consider myself one more model in the industry, I show off something innate in me, the sensuality. We all have something that makes us different and special and that’s the key to my success.</p>
<figure style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/eva-padlock-instagram.jpg" alt="Eva-Padlock" width="748" height="497" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Eva Padlock on Instagram</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Any tips or advice for those models that want to follow your same steps?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen in my network, it’s clear that my greatest power is to show my charms, always in an elegant and sensual way, but from the private messages I receive, I’m happy to know that most people who follow me and don’t know me, see what’s beyond the superficial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What features have helped you become the social model you are on Instagram?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be yourself always and feel comfortable with what you post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow Eva on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/evapadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to see some more of her amazing work. And don&#8217;t miss her campaign for <strong><a href="https://www.alpecin.es/?utm_source=mm&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mmblogpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpecin</a></strong>!</p>

<h2><strong>Do:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Be on time</strong></h3>
<p>We know you heard about the expression fashionable late, but in <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/become-a-model/">modeling</a> it doesn&#8217;t apply. You have a curfew that needs to be respected.</p>
<h3><strong>Be nice to the team</strong></h3>
<p>No one likes a b*tchy attitude. You&#8217;re not the center of the universe, so don&#8217;t act likewise.</p>
<h3><strong>Study the shooting theme</strong></h3>
<p>If you have the resources. Sometimes you have mood boards, ideas, themes that the team is sharing to your shooting group so it&#8217;s nice to be prepared. Modeling is not just standing like a pile of straws, it binds beauty with acting skills. A good model passes over through the photo so much more than her beauty, it passes a self expression, a feeling, something deeper.</p>
<h3><strong>Be in your upmost best physical and mental shape</strong></h3>
<p>Leave sorrows at home and remember to always take good care of yourself. No chewed nails or yellow teeth!</p>
<h3><strong>Have everything talked before the shooting</strong></h3>
<p>Like payment, work hours, etc. It&#8217;s better to have everything straighten out from the very beginning.</p>

<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cancel a shooting last minute</strong></h3>
<p>Unless there is a health emergency or you&#8217;re very ill. Remember there is a whole team behind a shooting, so probably they&#8217;ve taken the day off especially for this job or there are cases where the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/">photographer</a> has rented cars, horses, etc. So that&#8217;s a big no-no!</p>
<h3><strong>Try to take over the shooting if you&#8217;re not paying</strong></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you work for a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling agency</a>, they&#8217;ve hired you to do your modeling job, not to start and give out pointers to the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photographer</a> or <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/fashion-stylists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stylist</a>. They know best, it&#8217;s their job.</p>
<h3><strong>Start a fight with someone on set</strong></h3>
<p>We know sometimes people from the art world are more difficult than others, or more impulsive; not all characters are meant to get along. So put on a smile and just try to stay zen until the end of the job.</p>
<h3><strong>Leak pictures from the shooting on your social accounts</strong></h3>
<p>It happens sometimes that you&#8217;re pretty excited about a shooting and can&#8217;t wait to share it with your friends (and haters of course). But do ask permission before posting anything. Some companies or photographers don&#8217;t enjoy having their work already online before the final result.</p>
<h3><strong>Come with makeup on or your hair done at the shooting</strong></h3>
<p>Only if otherwise stated. It takes hours to bring a model back to a &#8220;natural condition&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is a very powerful tool for <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models</a>, and in most cases it&#8217;s even essential, not to say&#8230;vital! Professional such as <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photographers</a> and <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling agencies</a> are very active in social media and often use social networks such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> to scout models!</p>
<p>Therefore, being a social media <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model</a> is something quite important. We&#8217;ve heard stories about models that got famous thanks to social media, such as <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/tatiana-marinescu/">Tatiana Marinescu</a>, who has been featured in magazine covers and campaigns.</p>
<p>Are YOU willing to have your own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook fan page</a>? Looking for some useful tips to make your fan page successful? Well&#8230; you are reading the right post! Just follow those simple steps and you will be closer to social media success. Let the world know you are out there!</p>
<h2><strong>1. Description</strong></h2>
<p>The description you include in your fan page is very important! What should you include?</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModelManagement.com</a> model profile<br />
&#8211; Website (if you have one)<br />
&#8211; Your other social media links (if any)<br />
&#8211; Your latest work including some links (if any)<br />
&#8211; Information about yourself<br />
&#8211; Your email address</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/industry-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry professionals</a> that visit your profile will for sure have a read!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve just started in the modeling industry, don&#8217;t worry! Add your ModelManagement.com profile and a short description about yourself!</p>
<figure style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Ruben-300x193.png" alt="Ruben-ModelManagement.com" width="448" height="288" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ruben on ModelManagement.com</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>2. Cover Picture</strong></h2>
<p>When people visit your fan page the first thing they see is your <strong>Cover Picture</strong>, even before they see your profile picture or the content in it. So use a very <strong>cool</strong> and <strong>catchy</strong> picture of yourself! If possible, change this image once a week for one of your latest shoots or campaigns. Of course, you should also include a cool and current <strong>Profile Picture</strong>, but you don&#8217;t have to change this one that often.</p>
<figure style="width: 367px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lucia-Costa-makeup.jpg" alt="Lucía Costa" width="367" height="550" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Model Lucía Costa</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>3. Posts</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you are all set you should start posting before you invite people to your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook</a> page, it’s better to have some content first!</p>
<h3><strong>Images and Text</strong></h3>
<p>All your posts must be very visual! Share your <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling pictures</a> with a two line description to tell people about them. But be careful! You should keep the text short, long texts are usually not read. You can always share a link so your fans can visit your <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model profile</a> or site.</p>
<h3><strong>Hashtags</strong></h3>
<p>Hashtags are very important! You should include a few in your post, using the most common ones such as <strong>#model, #modeling, #tbt, #portrait</strong> etc. You can also come up with your own hashtag!</p>
<p>If you have the possibility to mention someone in your picture, do so! For example, if you have a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model</a> shot taken by a <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photographer</a> mention him in the text and tag him in the picture!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FBfanpage.jpeg" alt="" width="1350" height="901" /></p>
<h2><strong>4. Get Fans</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve shared some content on your fan page you can <strong>invite your friends</strong>! On the bottom part of your cover image you will find three dots &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;, click on it and you will find the “Invite Friends…” option.  Invite them all! You can also ask your friends to share your page or one of your posts to help you gain more views, shares, likes and fans!</p>
<p>Include your new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook</a> fan page on your <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModelManagement.com</a> profile, it&#8217;s a great way to make <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agencies</a>, <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/industry-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry professionals</a> and <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photographers</a> know you are active on social media!</p>
<h2><strong>5. What and When to Post</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you have some content, a great cover picture and some fans you have to keep your page active!</p>
<p>a) You should <strong>post 2 or 3 times a day</strong>.</p>
<p>b) You can also post pictures from your <strong>daily life</strong>, not everything has to be related to your modeling career, your fans also want to know what you do!</p>
<p>&#8211;   Today you are wearing a great <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">style</a>? Share it with your fans!</p>
<p>&#8211;   Are you in a fashion show? Your fans will love to see what you are seeing!</p>
<p>&#8211;  Want to thank your fans for their support? Do so!</p>
<p>&#8211;   Are you in a photo shoot? Share backstage pictures!</p>

<h2><strong>6. Facebook Groups</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from being active on your own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> fan page, you should also be posting content on other Facebook pages such as Facebook group! You will find tonnes of <strong>Modeling Groups</strong> where you can share your fan page and meet other <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models</a>! You just have to do a search on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modelmgmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>!</p>
<p>We hope these tips were useful for you. Now it&#8217;s time to be active and successful!</p>
