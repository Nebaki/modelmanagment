										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Born in Venezuela, Séneca is an external financial director for SMEs. She has lived in Barcelona for seven years, but at seventeen she moved to Europe and has also lived in Ireland, England and Germany. Intelligent, passionate and above all, a fighter, she has been pursuing for her great professional dream in the world of finance for two years with the creation of her first company.</p>
<h2 class="p1">How did you get interested in creating your own company?</h2>
<p class="p1">After working in different companies, I felt that I had not quite found my place. My parents were always very conservative on a professional level, very hard-working people… but are not a family of entrepreneurs or businessmen. I have studied a lot and my plan was always to work in a multinational company and have a long professional career there. I think it&#8217;s good to work in a multinational at the beginning of your career and for a while, because you can learn how a company is structured. After this experience, I believe that the secret lies in transferring the knowledge acquired in big companies to the small ones, who can be your client.</p>
<p class="p1">After I finished my studies, I worked in a consulting company and I liked it a lot, but I realized that it was not quite my thing. Later I worked in other companies, of all kinds, big and small companies, but I kept feeling that I was not in the place that I really wanted to be. So, I was bold enough and I started to work as a freelancer after a long time meditating whether to dare to do it. The secret is to go for it with all your strength.</p>

<h2 class="p1">What was that impasse like?</h2>
<p class="p1">I dared to leave the company I worked for after consolidating my first client. I wasn’t making a lot of money, but it did give me enough confidence to start my own project. A month after quitting the job, the pandemic hit our lives&#8230; but even this and the difficult times, I never regretted the decision.</p>
<p class="p1">At the beginning, I did not imagine how difficult the path would be. It has been a difficult and sacrificed journey. It is also a lonely road. But I do not regret. Currently I am very happy, and everything is getting better and better.</p>
<h2 class="p1">What is your company about?</h2>
<p class="p1">I give financial support to companies. Create and analyze budgets, how companies close financially annually, plan the strategy for the next year&#8230; I help companies in the search for financing, consolidation and make reports that show business health, cashflow&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1">For the last four months, I have also been recording training courses on YouTube and it is something that I am passionate about. I love teaching and communicating, and I want to dedicate more time to their creation. Finance courses help people who have created a business to manage and understand it. I had a hard time putting myself out there at first, but I feel like I&#8217;ve improved a lot since then. As a businesswoman, videos offer confidence and show my personality and knowledge to clients.</p>

<h2 class="p1">How much time do you dedicate to your company?</h2>
<p class="p1">A lot. At the beginning I spent practically all my time at work, having very little time for enjoyment. Little by little I am understanding that I also must have time to enjoy, quality time for myself. I have had to force myself a little to lower my self-demand, have more patience and take care of myself and my time a little more. I dedicate all my effort to my business, but I also must live the moment, have fun and enjoy the free time&#8230;</p>
<h2>What are the advantages of being your own boss?</h2>
<p class="p1">Freedom. It is true that I work a lot, but I know that I also add much more value to my work than working in a big company, where I feel that I am only a small part of the gear and therefore the value that I can contribute is much less. Now, being my own boss, I decide how much dedication and how much value I want to give to a project&#8230; And of course, the other advantage is my time management. Recently, being autonomous allowed me to travel to Venezuela to spend three months accompanying my father before his death&#8230; I can also live wherever I want. I wanted to live near the beach, and I have achieved it by moving to Lloret de Mar, where I have a much lower rent than in Barcelona, ​​which allows me to save and invest more money to my company.</p>
<h2 class="p1">What is the most complicated thing?</h2>
<p class="p1">Loneliness and responsibility, it is all on me. Also, not being able to go on vacation or being afraid of getting sick, because if I&#8217;m not working there is no one who can do the job… The next step I want to achieve is to start having a team and delegate functions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-86136 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PXL_20221103_173526618.PORTRAIT-1-1.jpg" alt="seneca_modelmanagement" width="1125" height="1500" srcset="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PXL_20221103_173526618.PORTRAIT-1-1.jpg 1125w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PXL_20221103_173526618.PORTRAIT-1-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PXL_20221103_173526618.PORTRAIT-1-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PXL_20221103_173526618.PORTRAIT-1-1-38x50.jpg 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></p>

<h2 class="p1">When your father dies, just during the process of creating your first company&#8230; What was your management to move forward?</h2>
<p class="p1">Obviously, that event changed me and my live forever. I used to live thinking about productivity above all else, in an obsessive way, I would say. At that time, I also had a very exhausting client and I decided to cancel the client so that I could focus on my father, because I couldn&#8217;t do both things, taking care of the client and my father, at the same time. When he passed away and I returned to Barcelona, ​​I was determined to be the same ultra-productive Séneca as before, but I couldn&#8217;t. My body didn’t allow me to be that productive because I just wasn&#8217;t the same person I used to be. This whole process made me Séneca 2.0.</p>
<p class="p1">I learned to relativize time. If I have a goal, I will achieve it, I am sure, but I’ve learnt that it doesn&#8217;t have to be immediately. I am learning to take it easy and give myself space to heal. If you are OK, believe me, clients begin to arrive. You must be in good mental condition to accept projects and be good at it.</p>
<h2 class="p1">What advice would you give to someone who wants to start a business?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h2>
<p class="p1">I would recommend doing it little by little. My process was slow, it took me a year, from when I first thought about it to when I made it happen. It is also important to be aware that it will be a learning and a continuous improvement. No matter how many studies, how many degrees I had, when I started my new business, I didn’t know many things, I had to learn a lot. At first you won&#8217;t have very good clients, but you won&#8217;t be either the best at your field and you&#8217;ll make mistakes, but you&#8217;ll learn, and you&#8217;ll be a little better every day. It&#8217;s also good that it&#8217;s a slow process, your head needs that time to be able to assimilate everything you&#8217;re doing and the changes you&#8217;re facing.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Photographer: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography/"><strong>Andreas von Estorff</strong></a>    Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/seneca-noguera/">Séneca Noguera</a></h6>
<h2 class="p1">Your relationship with <span class="s1">modelmanagement.com</span> also started as a business relationship…</h2>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s how it is! I first contacted <span class="s1">modelmanagement.com</span> through LinkedIn. I have done a lot of networking through social media, and I contacted to offer them my services as CFO. Finally, an opportunity arose, and we began a professional relationship after meeting Andreas.</p>
<h2 class="p1">How did your photo shoot come about?</h2>
<p class="p1">The first time I met Andreas, it was as if we had known each other forever, we liked each other so much… When he proposed me to do a photo shoot, I thought it was a great idea and, also, I could use the professional images for my own website. It was perfect.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-86076 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1.jpg" alt="seneca_modelmanagement" width="1500" height="2250" srcset="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1.jpg 1500w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-33x50.jpg 33w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC06440-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Photographer: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography/"><strong>Andreas von Estorff</strong></a>    Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/es/model/seneca-noguera/">Séneca Noguera</a></h6>
<h2 class="p1">Have you modeled before?</h2>
<p class="p1">Never! I must admit that at first, it was a bit difficult for me. I was a little embarrassed because I had never modeled and for me it was something new and the truth is that before the shooting. However, the reality is that there were five hours of session that flew by. Andreas made me explore and bring out different Sénecas that I&#8217;m not normally use to in my day-to-day life. Normally I am the professional Séneca and the truth is that there are many more. It was very special to remember them and to externalize different parts of myself.</p>
<h2 class="p1">What advice did Andreas give you?</h2>
<p class="p1">It was very funny because Andreas quickly realized how controlling I can be with myself. I was so surprised that he saw it so quickly. But little by little I took the pressure and nerves off me&#8230; He helped me imagine scenes, to put myself in a situation, to focus on the moment, and I began to feel more and more comfortable, and it was a wonderful experience. Working with Andreas is incredible, he makes you feel calm, self-confident, and authentic. I loved it and I am so grateful for the time we shared together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna is many Annas. Teacher, nutritionist, model, singer&#8230; But when we ask her to choose a main profession, she tells us that there is none, that she is multifaceted and it is not possible, nor does she want, to be pigeonholed. Anna, above all things, is unpredictable and faces her life moved by passion and doing exactly what she really wants.</p>
<p>She speaks and expresses herself very well, she has experience speaking and showing herself in public. During her career she has done dozens of interviews in castings, auditions and she has had a successful passage through the Miss World Spain contest. In this interview, Anna shows us that she is self-confident, restless and passionate, as well as very sweet, respectful and smiling.</p>
<h2><strong>Who is Anna?</strong></h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself as a unique person, because I have many hobbies, many things that I like and I feel that I live several lives at the same time and that is why sometimes I don&#8217;t have time to do everything I would like to do.</p>
<p>I am a very natural girl, who does not hide from anything and I&#8217;m a continuous learner, I always like to prosper, I don&#8217;t like to settle down and I need the adrenaline of trying new things&#8230; Challenge myself and see if I can improve myself, is something I love.</p>
<p>Every time I get it, for me it is very satisfying and I always look for a few more doses of those moments. That&#8217;s why I love to sing, to model, to dance, to act&#8230; and to educate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-86084 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3.jpg" alt="anna_modelmanagement" width="1018" height="1500" srcset="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3.jpg 1018w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3-695x1024.jpg 695w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3-768x1132.jpg 768w, https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC05298_4-3-34x50.jpg 34w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">Photographer: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/member/ave-photography/"><strong>Andreas von Estorff</strong></a>    Model: <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model/anna-aznar-salvado/?tab=reviews">Anna Aznar</a></h6>
<h2><strong>What gives you the most adrenaline?</strong></h2>
<p>Singing makes me feel very good, it allows me to express many things that sometimes it is difficult for me to say, besides, I think that my feelings come out very well through the songs. I love it&#8230; And I should do it more, I should spend more time singing. Being a model also makes me feel great and, although I don&#8217;t work as a model the hundred percent of my time, since I&#8217;ve been working with modelmanagement.com I am always immersed in some jobs or projects. Teaching fulfills me a lot as a person and I also learn a lot from others. Each little thing completes me a lot in its own way.</p>
<h2><strong>Not everyone likes to do many different things at the same time&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>It is true, many people prefer to practice a single profession or many people are moved only for one hobby. I need much more, I am insatiable in this aspect. My own students are surprised that, besides being a teacher, I am also a model who also posts videos singing on YouTube&#8230; And it&#8217;s a shame because this ideology is imposed by society. They have, for example, the figure of a teacher, as a very intelligent person and a bookworm, as a person who only likes to study&#8230; I only believe in perseverance, if I like something I won’t stop until I get it. This is my vision of life.</p>

<h2><strong>Everything you like has to do with being exposed to an audience.</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s true, I don&#8217;t like being hidden. It is clear that when you are a model it is because you also like to be seen, you seek to feel recognized with what you are doing. Yes, everything I have done has been showing myself to the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Having a nice physique, has made you experience uncomfortable situations?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, of course. Like, comparisons between the physique of women, for example. Or when someone is surprised to see that I&#8217;m a smart girl, as if because of my appearance I had to be dumb… Some people think that being pretty and intelligent are not compatible adjectives for women. We must change this superficial vision.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the hardest part of being a teacher?</strong></h2>
<p>When you have doubts when solving a question, or knowing how to manage uncomfortable situations with your students.I think that young people nowadays are very susceptible and sometimes managing their emotions is not easy. They are called crystal generation because they quickly become offended or demoralized.</p>
<h2><strong>And what about singing, how did it appear in your life?</strong></h2>
<p>It all started during my childhood, when I was eight or nine years old. There was a program on TV &#8220;Eurojunior&#8221; that I loved, I even auditioned! I used to sing a lot at home and my mother told me that I sang very well, but of course, I thought she was flattering me because she is my mother… But over time I also studied music theory and piano. Later I was chosen to sing in a musical, but I was studying nutrition and I chose to study. Currently, I am immersed in a project for a new song that will come out in a while.</p>
<h2><strong>What about your musical inspiration?</strong></h2>
<p>I have always loved “La Oreja de Van Gogh” and its first vocalist, Amaia Montero, is one of my favorite singers, without a doubt. I really like her personality and I think that my way of transmitting the songs is very similar to hers and our voices are quite similar, as well.</p>

<h2><strong>At what stage of your life does modeling appear?</strong></h2>
<p>It all happened when I was very young and happened a bit by chance. A modeling agency in Reus was holding a beauty pageant down the street. I saw it and signed up. I went through phases until I won. At that moment I realized that I liked it, so I decided to join the agency. For a while my extracurricular activity was to go to the agency and learn photography, protocol, makeup, nutrition&#8230; And all that helped me a lot to learn and make the leap to international agencies. Over time I signed up for different castings where I did very well, to the point of being second in Miss World Spain.</p>
<h2><strong>How was the experience in Miss World?</strong></h2>
<p>The truth is that it was a learning experience, especially on an emotional level. This is a very demanding contest, you not only have to be physically perfect, you also sleep very little, you have a lot of pressure and there are moments of great tension. All these experiences have helped me grow, strengthen and enrich myself as a person.</p>
<h2><strong>Do you feel pressure to achieve perfection?</strong></h2>
<p>I like how I am, I&#8217;m not perfect but I&#8217;m don&#8217;t want to change or to please someone.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get closer to some specific canons imposed by society. Beauty is very subjective, it goes by fashion, so what matters most to me is being true to myself and it is important to know that, whatever you do, it is impossible to please everyone, so I see no point in pursuing perfection.</p>

<h2><strong>What advice would you give to a girl who is starting out in the modeling world?</strong></h2>
<p>I would tell her to follow her heart, that if this is her passion, she has to pursue it, but to never drop out of her studies. I would advise her not to get carried away by comments that are harmful or related to the appearance and weight of a person. The world is full of colors and for one agency you can be the best model of the catalog and for another, you can not fit in at all. Also, do not be badly influenced by anyone in this sector.</p>
<h2><strong>How did your relationship with modelmanagement.com start?</strong></h2>
<p>The first contact I had was participating in the Fresh Faces contest, where I was a finalist. After that experience, I signed up for different castings and I have always been getting projects, castings, photo sessions&#8230; One day Andreas invited me to the Barcelona headquarters. When I met him, we connected spiritually in a very magical way.</p>
<h2><strong>How was the photo shoot with Andreas?</strong></h2>
<p>Really fantastic. Andreas told me that he wanted some natural photos, without a lot of makeup, she wanted to show who I really am. He wanted to portray Anna, not a character, and he did it! Andreas made me feel very comfortable. Between shots we talked and he gave me some advice&#8230; He even asked me about my complexes and photographed them! Despite being my complexes, he portrayed them by embellishing them. Now I even like them when I see the photographs. It was wonderful. I came home feeling very fulfilled and amazed by his professionalism.</p>

<h2><strong>What would you highlight as the best characteristic of modelmanagement.com?</strong></h2>
<p>The website has enormous advantages over other agencies, in addition to being a global and online agency that brings you closer to any fashion professional from anywhere in the world with only a click. Years have passed and it is a wonderful tool for people in the world of modeling and acting, also for all those people who would not fit into the typical prototype that was established at the time. It is an agency fully open to all concepts of body, beauty, age&#8230; Since I discovered them at the age of sixteen, I have never stopped working on projects.</p>
<h2><strong>In addition, you have also participated in some Instagram live videos working for the agency!</strong></h2>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is! Taking advantage of my knowledge of nutrition, I have done some very interesting live videos and this has allowed me to show not only my facet as a model but also to contribute knowledge. I have also made videos about makeup&#8230; All of this makes me feel complete. In addition to giving me visibility, of course!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media play an essential role in today&#8217;s society and even though influencers are closely related to the internet, they have been existing for thousands of years. However, nowadays being an influencer has become the dream of many people, who apart from influencing others, dream of collaborating with big brands and making their life a constant trip. In this post, we are going to dig deeper into what an influencer is and we will give some tips on how to become an influencer.</p>
<h2>What does being an influencer really mean?</h2>
<p>The concept of an influencer appeared along with the first social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace. With the appearance of these channels, ordinary people started gaining more and more followers, becoming a reference in a specific sector. For this authority that the audience gives them, influencers have the power to influence [as the word points out] people and modify their behavior, whether it is to change their mind about a specific topic, buy a product or even visit a place.  <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-85545 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-cottonbro-9951663.jpg" alt="how-to-become-an-influencer" width="2333" height="3500" /></p>
<p>As mentioned before, influencers are nothing new. Throughout the ages, we had opinion leaders that were followed by the mass, such as Socrates, Martin Luther King, etc. So we could say that influencers are digital opinion leaders who also are <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/?s=content+creator">content creators</a>.</p>
<h2>Tips to Become an influencer</h2>
<p>Before getting into the steps, let&#8217;s define what an influencer is not:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Being an influencer is not just about the number of followers</strong>, but your real capacity of influencing your followers&#8217; behavior. There are people who buy followers to make brands believe that they are real influencers, but brands don&#8217;t only look at the number of followers, but for good insights and high engagement rates.</li>
<li>If you dream about <strong>being an influencer just to get free stuff</strong>, then we recommend you to think about it. Even though there is still debate, influencers are professional content creators for brands, so in the end, they don&#8217;t get free stuff, products are often part of the payment.</li>
<li>Being an influencer is not an easy job. Influencers often create the content themselves, which means that they&#8217;re acting as <strong>creative directors, photographers, stylists, makeup &amp; hair artists, editors, and copywriters.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-85549 size-full" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-ron-lach-8371403-2.png" alt="tips-to-become-an-influencer" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>So now that you know what an influencer is not, you are probably wondering how to become one. There isn&#8217;t an exact formula to be an influencer and to grow your followers, but there are some things you can start doing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find your niche.</strong> There are many influencers out there doing the same things. If you want to stand out from them, find what makes you unique and define your niche. If you are specialized in a topic, it will help you gain credibility with your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the platform that fits you best.</strong> Do you feel comfortable talking to the camera? Or do you prefer photos? Don&#8217;t push yourself to do things you&#8217;re not comfortable with because especially for video, you need to sound natural and confident. Depending on this, you can choose among different platforms, such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modelmanagement/">Instagram</a>, TikTok, Twitch, YouTube&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> It is not common to become an influencer overnight. You have to post constantly and even though you sometimes feel frustrated, visualize your goal and keep working.</li>
<li><strong>Your goal shouldn&#8217;t just be to become an influencer.</strong>  For example, if you are a plus-size curvy girl, your goal can be giving visibility to curvy bodies and inspiring others. This will help you be motivated and when you achieve these type of goals,  it&#8217;s way more satisfying.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to become a model, you will probably know that castings, or so-called auditions, are an essential part of the road. All models need to go to castings to audition for the jobs they want to get. For this reason, it&#8217;s important you get properly ready and cause the best of impressions, including your makeup. If you&#8217;re not sure <strong>how to do your makeup for a casting</strong>, keep reading this post to find out!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85494" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-cottonbro-10547289-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" /></p>
<p>Before getting into it, you need to understand what clients are looking for in castings. Are they looking for an attitude? Probably and mostly yes. But they&#8217;re also looking for an appearance and this is where makeup comes into play.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.modelmanagement.com/en-model-academy/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84396" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In auditions, casting directors want to see the model in real life and the more natural the look is, the better. This way, they can see your real beauty without any distractions. And you may wonder how this translates into your makeup. Well, the answer is easy: all you need is a natural makeup look, that covers your little imperfections and <strong>highlights your natural features</strong>.</p>
<h2>How to do your makeup?</h2>
<p>Take note of the following steps to create the perfect makeup look for your next casting.</p>
<p><strong>1. Foundation</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t recommend using a high coverage foundation. The lighter it is, the better. This will help you unify your skin tone. No-foundation is also a good option.</p>
<p><strong>2. Concealer</strong></p>
<p>Add just a tiny bit of concealer in those areas where you need some coverage. This might be your under-eye bags, some pimples, and irritations. You can also apply concealer strategically so you highlight your features such as the nose, eyebrows, and lips. For that, add a bit of concealer on your septum, under the eyebrows, and on the cupid&#8217;s bow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85496" src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-cottonbro-10545197.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Mattifying powder</strong></p>
<p>The powder is an essential in every model&#8217;s bag. When you&#8217;re on camera, it&#8217;s very important to control the highlights of your face, otherwise, the skin will look very oily. The best option is to use translucid powders (with no color). It will help you control the highlights, and at the same time, it will set your makeup so it lasts longer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Blush</strong></p>
<p>Blush will help to give some color to your face. Choose a warm color that matches your skin tone and avoid dark shades that won&#8217;t help you get a natural look.</p>
<p><strong>5. Mascara</strong></p>
<p>Applying a bit of mascara on your eyelashes will help you enlonger your eyes and uplift your look. Make sure to use the wand to help you brush your eyelashes and avoid adding too much for it not to look lumpy.</p>
<p>And this is all you need to know about how to do your makeup for a casting. You can learn more on <strong>how to get ready for castings with the Model Academy</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New models often ask themselves whether they have what it takes to become a model</h2>
<p>You are likely to hear that to be a model you need to be beautiful, tall and slender with perfect proportions. Now this is certainly true for high fashion models, where designers want one type of model that they feel shows off their designs in the best way.</p>
<p>However, if you do not fit this criteria, don’t despair as there are many other areas that you can work in successfully and lucratively as a model. The modeling industry needs <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/">all different shapes and sizes</a>. It ranges from the models who are required for the runways of Paris and Milan to those being seen in the background of TV commercials. You need to find the right fit for you and your place in the industry. To help you with this we have listed the different types of modeling work that’s available and the criteria for each, and as with most things in life there are always exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/castings/"><img src="http://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/CASTINGS_MODELS_Banner.jpg" alt="Apply to model castings" /></a></p>
<h2>High Fashion</h2>
<p>When you see the incredibly tall and lean figures that grace the runways and editorials for the leading fashion houses and designers, these are the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/high-fashion/">high fashion models</a>. They are generally required to be between 172cm to 180cm (5”8 to 5”11), with a dress size of 4-6 US (6-8 UK), with a typical bust size of 34. The age range can be from 14 to 25.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/Screenshot-2020-10-27-at-15.44.13.png"><img src="https://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/high_fashion2.jpg" alt="High Fashion Models" /></a><br />
For guys the age range is more flexible and they can start from the age of 16 until their late 40’s. They need to be between 180cm to 188cm (5”11 to 6”2), with an excellent physique and a chest size of 94cm to 106cm (37” to 42”) and 76cm to 81cm (30” to 32”) waist. Guys tend to have longer careers if they look after themselves.</p>
<h2>Editorial Print</h2>
<p>This is modeling for magazine editorials and covers such as Vogue, Elle etc. The standard requirements for these models are similar to those in High Fashion and you must be very photogenic. Quite often the same models will work in both Editorial Print and High Fashion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/high-fashion/"><img src="http://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/Editorial-1.jpg" alt="Editorial Models" /></a><br />
These editorials provide great exposure for models even though the fees earned are sometimes relatively low. This is normal and it can take a few years to gain the experience needed to get the bigger paying jobs.</p>
<h2>Commercial Print</h2>
<p>A huge market that encompasses every kind of print advertising. This can range from advertising in magazines to products on supermarket shelves to billboards. The benefit of working in <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/commercial/">Commercial Print</a> as a model is that the target audience of the advertisers varies considerably.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/commercial/"><img src="http://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/Commercial.jpg" alt="Commercial Models" /></a><br />
Naturally the brands want to attract and represent the people that will buy their products, so there are many opportunities here if you are not the High Fashion type.</p>
<h2>Catalogue Modeling</h2>
<p>Companies create catalogues (print or online) to sell their latest clothing lines or various others products, and it’s the <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/catalog/">catalogue model’s</a> job to make them look good. Here you will find many great opportunities for different model types, as the model is chosen to represent the target audience of the different companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/catalog/"><img src="http://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/Catalog.jpg" alt="Catalog Models" /></a><br />
With the increasing number of websites that require models to promote their goods online, this is very lucrative for many models.</p>
<h2>Plus Size Modeling</h2>
<p>Modeling for the larger body type, this type of modeling is on the increase and a relatively new phenomenon. If you’re confident, with great attributes and you are between the sizes of 12-16 US (14-18 UK) then this could be for you. More and more advertisers are using <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/plus-sized/">Plus size models</a> to promote their products in a bid to appeal to a broader demographic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/plus-sized/"><img src="http://www.modelmanagement.com/blog/library/uploads/Plus_Size.jpg" alt="Apply to model castings" /></a><br />
As a Plus Size model you will still need to have great skin, teeth and hair and have that something special about you. For High Fashion Plus Sized Models the height requirements remain at a minimum of 172cm (5”8).</p>
<h2>Glamour Modeling</h2>
<p>Is modeling that emphasises a models sexuality. <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/glamour/">Glamour modeling</a> can range from lingerie and swimwear shoots, to artistic and nude photography to men’s magazines.

<h2>TV Commercials</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/video/">Modeling in TV commercials</a> does not have any overall criteria for height, size and age, as each commercial requires someone different and specific to that job. It is usually necessary to have some acting ability, but this can be natural ability or learned. There are many different types of TV commercials, ranging from the highly stylised photographic, to the performance led reality style.</p>

The great advantage in TV commercials for a model is that brands are continuously seeking models, which the general public can easily identify with. This opens up the doors to almost everyone, who feels that they have what it takes to work in this sector. Typically those represented by a model or actors agency have a better chance of appearing in TV commercials.</p>
<h2>Real Life Models (People Models) and TV/Film Extras</h2>
<p>If you like the idea of modeling, but do not fit into the above categories, then this could be for you. <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/model-images/real-life-and-people">Real life and people models</a> are used in advertising or corporate campaigns, when companies are looking to represent the everyday person. As a TV/Film Extra you will generally be non-featured (no speaking parts) and in the background of a scene.</p>

This can be fun and interesting to be part of, but it can also be long hours with lots of waiting around. The benefits are that if you are flexible with your days, it can be a good way to supplement your income.</p>
<h2>Influencer Models</h2>
<p>Brands are recognising the value in people that have very large social media followings. Typically these would be people who have an interesting look, whether that&#8217;s because they are beautiful, sexy, tattooed, pierced, alternative, busty or quirky, and the current trend is that these people have profiles on Instagram; coining the phrase Instagram models. However from a brands perspective these models are called <a href="https://www.modelmanagement.com/ranking/top-female-model-influencers-on-instagram/">Influencer Models</a> due to the influence that they have when they publish a post. Brands will approach one of these influencers and suggest a collaboration, where the model will post an endorsement of the brand’s product, and in return the model will receive financial compensation or free products from the brand.</p>

If an Influencer Model can attract high numbers of Loves and clicks on the brands website, the influencer can demand a higher compensation. This is a fantastic new side to the model industry which makes modeling once again more accessible to everyone.</p>
